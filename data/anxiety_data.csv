,Anxiety,"Hello Reddit, forgive me I am new here but I really can't take this anymore without at least having someone hear out my problem. 

I'm a 19 year old female and my anxiety for awhile has been nothing more than fear of phone calls, public speaking and just minor things here or there. For some reason for like, 2 years now I have been having this problem where my mind will just run absolutely wild whenever I finally lay down to sleep.

 As I'm typing this from my phone I am currently trying to sleep right now since I need to work tomorrow.

It seems like things have just been getting worse and these nights appear more frequently and I'm just not sure why.

The things that happen are;

Gets very hard to breathe

Sudden thoughts about me dying in my sleep

Thinking existentially about if anyone will check on me (I live with my mom and grandma)

Wondering if my work would worry about me

Where will I go if I do die

Yadda yadda yadda...



I really can't take this anymore. It makes me crippled to tears almost every night and I just want it to stop. I can't really talk to my mom about these things because she has this weird thing where like...she just doesn't say anything and I feel like she thinks if she ignores this stuff that it'll go away.

,Anxiety,"My fiancé and I (both 25) have a single issue and it’s my anxiety around doing adult chores. I get anxious about tidying up. I like being able to see all my things. I feel like it’s easier for me to find stuff when everything is out instead of put away. I get anxiety over checking my bank account. Or paying bills. I don’t have any kind of insurance because it stresses me out to think about doing it. I don’t know anything about any kind of insurance. 

I think it’s because growing up my family was very poor. My mom could never find her things and would yell at us. I always know where our things are because I see them while looking for other things. She would yell at us because she couldn’t afford to pay our bills and she never went to the doctor because she didn’t have health insurance. All the issues in my life were because of money and I hate dealing with it. 

And then I get the worst anxiety when he lectures me on how we need to be saving money and keeping the house tidy and keeping up with our bills and taxes.

I get anxious about tidying up. I like being able to see all my things. I feel like it’s easier for me to find stuff when everything is out instead of put away. I get anxiety over checking my bank account. Or paying bills. I don’t have any kind of insurance because it stresses me out to think about doing it. I don’t know anything about any kind of insurance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s because growing up my family was very poor. My mom could never find her things and would yell at us. I always know where our things are because I see them while looking for other things. She would yell at us because she couldn’t afford to pay our bills and she never went to the doctor because she didn’t have health insurance. All the issues in my life were because of money and I hate dealing with it. &lt;/p&gt;

I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, and I've always been a hypochondriac. In the past ive been convinced I had various cancers, IBS, appendicitis and heart disease, among other things. 

Long story short after starting uni in september I went from drinking zero to too much (really started in November). I'm not an alcoholic; I just had an unhealthy habit. This has been an issue before with unhealthy food &amp; energy drinks, which were actually much more difficult to give up; it was definitely too much of a good thing. I'm a bit annoyed I didn't see it coming really given my past excesses. I guess being surrounded by people who do drink lots subconsciously reinforces it as acceptable... My parents are very anti alcohol and as such I was brought up that way, I'd also be devastated to dissappoint them. I also think I kind of felt free once I moved to uni so went a bit over the top.

 Once I started I found I never really liked mad binge drinking (though I did get drunk a good few times). I mostly just drank casually with flatmates (never alone). In January though I had a bit of a crazy week and went out 3 times. I felt like shit at the end, and it was a bit of a wake up call. It made me realise the damage it could do without just laughing it off, and I genuinely believed I was going to die of liver failure.

From that I decided to stop (which hasn't been a problem at all, I don't feel the need to drink or get withdrawal). Two weeks later I had a couple drinks for a special occasion (planned ahead; wasn't on a whim) and was very careful. A week later (today) and I've got huge anxiety over the damage I could have done. I genuinely believe I'm experiencing liver failure, even if most of the ""symptoms"" I'm experiencing are tenuous at best (even if I don't believe it). I had a panic attack and my heart has been racing since, currently lying in bed at 85bpm when my resting is 50 odd 😬.

I keep checking my skin and eyes in the mirror, I keep prodding my stomach to check for pains. Ive also become hyper aware of my body so any tiny pain that I otherwise wouldn't feel makes me think it's my liver and I'm going to die.

,Anxiety,"SPS isn’t a disorder, and I know this, but it feels amplified whenever I’m even remotely nervous or anxious. 

I think the biggest issue is that I have started to become bothersome and annoying to people that are close to me. I’m hyper aware of slight atmospheric or emotional fluctuations, and I usually have very visceral reactions to any amount of emotional potency or pain. 

I missed a week of school this past week, and having to catch up on everything made me feel as if everything was imploding. I had too many things to do on a tight schedule, so I couldn’t concentrate on doing any of my work. Thinking about it zapped the energy right out of me and resulted in total sensory overload. 

I also have ARFID, which is really just annoying at this point, and it detracts a lot from my daily life.

,Anxiety,"Before I start, I realize how foolish I was and I can't stop beating myself up over it. I want to cry... I feel so overwhelmed.

So I was taking my daily commute to school yesterday. My anxiety has been really bad lately especially while driving. I'm on the highway, no problem. Things are going smooth besides the raging anxious thoughts in my mind. The traffic is thick so we all come to a stop. I sit there, eyeing the cars in front of me, around me, thinking about tackling my day and then... All of a sudden I hear tires screech and then... BOOM! My car jolts forward and I am slightly stunned. A wave of anxiety rushes over me and I feel... helpless. Immediately I start shaking, hyperventilating, I'm on the verge of tears and I see the driver behind me come out of his car and ask me if I'm okay. I had 911 on the phone but I hung up because I saw the back of my car was relatively okay. I was so shaken up and not thinking clearly plus I've never been in an accident before where I was behind the wheel. I didn't take any of his information. I wasn't thinking at all. We both parted ways because I was so anxious and afraid and I didn't want my insurance to go up because I'm young and I didn't even do anything wrong! I'm not sure if this is true, but my mom always told me that sometimes even if you are not at fault your insurance will still go up.

&amp;#x200B;

Now part of me keeps thinking about it. Sometimes I'm angry because I think he might've been texting while driving and honestly part of me wishes his insurance went up so he would learn his lesson!!!  There are tiny scratches and 2 holes on my bumper but my car is old to begin with and it had marks on the back when I purchased it but every time I look at those new blemishes it reminds me of the incident. Every time I get behind the wheel I think about it.... The impact, the noise, the feeling... It just won't go away. It's eating my up inside. I feel so stupid though for not taking any info, but I just was so anxious and in shock. I wanted it all to be over.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure why I'm posting this. I guess to just air my feelings out... idk.

We both parted ways because I was so anxious and afraid and I didn&amp;#39;t want my insurance to go up because I&amp;#39;m young and I didn&amp;#39;t even do anything wrong! I&amp;#39;m not sure if this is true, but my mom always told me that sometimes even if you are not at fault your insurance will still go up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now part of me keeps thinking about it. Sometimes I&amp;#39;m angry because I think he might&amp;#39;ve been texting while driving and honestly part of me wishes his insurance went up so he would learn his lesson!!!  There are tiny scratches and 2 holes on my bumper but my car is old to begin with and it had marks on the back when I purchased it but every time I look at those new blemishes it reminds me of the incident. Every time I get behind the wheel I think about it.... The impact, the noise, the feeling... It just won&amp;#39;t go away. It&amp;#39;s eating my up inside. I feel so stupid though for not taking any info, but I just was so anxious and in shock. I wanted it all to be over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure why I&amp;#39;m posting this. I guess to just air my feelings out... idk. I&amp;#39;m just sitting here feeling emotionally overwhelmed and on the verge of tears because I feel like I let someone get away with something serious that they need to learn from. (possibly texting and driving idk).&lt;/p&gt;

I always wear dark colors
I wear black hoodies and beanies alot
I have big black eyes
I have dark facial hair
I often get mistaken for being indian and sometimes mexican

,Anxiety,"I have traveled a whole lot in my life, but I'm not all that happy about it. What sucks most about traveling so often is the fact that there is NEVER anything concrete, every single fucking time it happens, I am forced to leave a whole bunch of the hard work I put into making friends, integrating myself, getting comfortable in the new space and lots of stuff like that. It really sucks, the worst part is when I try to talk about it with someone at school and feel bad about it, it feels horrible. You see, I absolutely adore talking to other people, I love talking about life, games, anime and whatever the fuck else comes to mind, so when I try to convince myself it's a good topic to talk about and it ends up being interesting to the other person I feel really bad, I don't fucking care about this topic, to me it's like unnecessarily derailing a conversation, we're talking about ourselves here, we don't need to talk about ""Oh wow! you've been to \_\_\_\_! That's really cool blah blah blah"", it feels like pandering, and I absolutely hate it, I don't know if I'm paranoid or what but I always feel like I'm being talked down to and patronized, I hate that feeling so much. I recently moved to Colombia, I've lived 3 years here if you put separate years together, I came to Colombia this time and only had like half a week to get ready for school and all that jazz, so, I started school here and there's where this comes from, this uncomfortableness. I've been in this school for about 5 or 6 weeks now, and it sucks. Let's start off with the most simple problem. Since I move so much from country to country I end up in a lot of different schools with a lot of different systems, so I always end up missing big important chunks of information, which ends up being very troubling here in Colombia, since the schools ask a lot from you. So that sucks, it would obviously be easier with a shoulder to lean on and use as support buuuuuut... nope, no such thing exists here right now, and that gets us to our next problem. I don't really have friends at this new school, I feel bad about saying that but I truly feel it, strongly. People have tried to talk to me but it's never been anything interesting, like life, just the generic ""Are you liking this school so far?"", which I've heard a million fucking times by now, it honest to god feels like torture because of how awkward I end up being, you see, I love talking to people, a lot, but I'm super socially awkward, so I end up feeling terrible after saying something serious-sounding to someone who's trying to talk to me, I need to warm up a whole lot before I can get in my comfort zone and talk and act myself, speaking of. I act differently around so many people, I just don't know what to do, it feels like a fucking puzzle game without a proper way to do anything, I feel so fucking lost all the time, the crushing crushing loneliness doesn't help me a fucking bit. One of the things I hate most about feeling this horrendous stress is how it reflects on my mind and feelings, I'm getting so mad about so many insignificant things, it ends up being this constant thing and every time I calm down I feel like absolute fucking trash for getting so mad, and all this comes back to me only to make it worst.

Now, I've said a whole lot of nothing, so let me talk about something a bit more relatable and understandable by the average human being.

We all have something we want to end up doing, even if we aren't fully sure of it or even know it. What sucks is when you know exactly what you want to do but aren't the slightest fucking bit good or descent at it. I hate it. I want to be an animator and/or musician (Singer-Piano). I've bought all these art things and my parents got me a piano for my birthday when I had previously show interest in it. Absolutely all these things (including my parents, aunts, uncles, cousins and even grandparents ) are screaming for me to get a move on and fucking do something. It all feels so fucking crushing for me, keeping in mind that I'm only 14 (15 in July 14th 2020) and have to keep up with all these fucking things, I've got severe whiplash from all of it, and that isn't even the end of it, but I don't want to spend another hour and forty minutes writing this, I've got a headache and am super tired, as you can probably guess. I just hope things get better.

I don&amp;#39;t really have friends at this new school, I feel bad about saying that but I truly feel it, strongly. People have tried to talk to me but it&amp;#39;s never been anything interesting, like life, just the generic &amp;quot;Are you liking this school so far?&amp;quot;, which I&amp;#39;ve heard a million fucking times by now, it honest to god feels like torture because of how awkward I end up being, you see, I love talking to people, a lot, but I&amp;#39;m super socially awkward, so I end up feeling terrible after saying something serious-sounding to someone who&amp;#39;s trying to talk to me, I need to warm up a whole lot before I can get in my comfort zone and talk and act myself, speaking of. I act differently around so many people, I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do, it feels like a fucking puzzle game without a proper way to do anything, I feel so fucking lost all the time, the crushing crushing loneliness doesn&amp;#39;t help me a fucking bit. One of the things I hate most about feeling this horrendous stress is how it reflects on my mind and feelings, I&amp;#39;m getting so mad about so many insignificant things, it ends up being this constant thing and every time I calm down I feel like absolute fucking trash for getting so mad, and all this comes back to me only to make it worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;ve said a whole lot of nothing, so let me talk about something a bit more relatable and understandable by the average human being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have something we want to end up doing, even if we aren&amp;#39;t fully sure of it or even know it. What sucks is when you know exactly what you want to do but aren&amp;#39;t the slightest fucking bit good or descent at it. I hate it. I want to be an animator and/or musician (Singer-Piano). I&amp;#39;ve bought all these art things and my parents got me a piano for my birthday when I had previously show interest in it. Absolutely all these things (including my parents, aunts, uncles, cousins and even grandparents ) are screaming for me to get a move on and fucking do something. It all feels so fucking crushing for me, keeping in mind that I&amp;#39;m only 14 (15 in July 14th 2020) and have to keep up with all these fucking things, I&amp;#39;ve got severe whiplash from all of it, and that isn&amp;#39;t even the end of it, but I don&amp;#39;t want to spend another hour and forty minutes writing this, I&amp;#39;ve got a headache and am super tired, as you can probably guess. I just hope things get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read through all this I want to say thank you, thank you for taking this time out of your day to read this super long post, I appreciate it a whole lot :) .&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Hi guys! 

Please excuse me if this is terribly formatted, I’m on mobile and don’t generally post anything except for the occasional cat pic.

I’m here for some general advice/tips on how to feel better as I’ve been struggling with really overwhelming anxiety lately. 

Now I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety since my early teens and I’m now 24, but it’s always really been the depression that was worse (with a side of anxiety, I guess). Now, however, I am finding myself having trouble with really REALLY high levels of anxiety. It’s particularly bad at night - I’ve been having panic attacks that seem to last for hours at at time every single night before bed. They leave me feeling weak and faint, my hands and legs go numb, I can’t breathe, I’m super nauseous, my heart pounds and my chest gets these sharp pains and I just have this overwhelming sense of pure terror. I usually end up curled in the foetal position and sobbing by the end. This has had a major impact on my ability to sleep and function. I honestly don’t know what’s triggering the panic attacks, but I know that the thing I worry most about at the moment is my health. When I’m having an attack, i’m obsessed with the thought that something is majorly wrong with me and I’m immediately about to die. I live alone, and the idea that I will just die overnight without the chance to say goodbye to anyone I love TERRIFIES ME. It never used to, but it really does now. I’ve never been particular concerned about my health. I’m young with no diagnosed major health issues (although my anxiety now has me convinced that I have about 27 different ones) The stress from all of this anxiety has caused actual physical symptoms to manifest which, in turn, make me more anxious so I’m stuck in a vicious cycle of freaking out. I’ve always been really good at listening to the rational part of me that speaks up when I’m anxious but I can’t seem to do this lately. The rational voice is still there but nothing it can say or do is enough to convince me that I’m not dying. 

I’m really starting to struggle with every aspect of life because of how exhausted I am and how worked up I get (I do get anxious about a lot of other things too). I’ve been talking to friends and family who have been really great but I feel like I’m being a huge burden with how needy I’ve been lately. I’ve been trying to deal with things constructively: giving up alcohol, going for walks, trying to eat healthier etc. I also saw my doctor and was prescribed a low dose of an antidepressant (which I have had before) and have only been taking this for about a week. I’m hoping to have some success with this, but was also really hoping you guys might be able to offer some tips and advice on getting through the panic attacks in the meantime, until the SSRI starts working to a noticeable degree. If anything, I’ve been getting worse as time goes on so any advice or support at all would be greatly appreciated!

&lt;p&gt;Anyone using IFS who has ideas/tools that work? I don’t want to spend all my time like this anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Had an anxiety accomplishment that I’m pretty excited about!

So, I am currently looking for a job and new career, which is difficult for a number of reasons, but especially since one of my anxiety triggers is anything relating to jobs (although I mostly seem to be OK being at work and can hold down a job). I recently discovered that the reason is because of my perfectionism and fear of failure after having difficulties with and choosing not to pursue my original career in teaching years ago. I’ve only recently started learning techniques related to perfectionism and getting rid of the uncomfortable thoughts. Before that, I had very little control over it.

I’ve done jobs stuff at home before my perfectionism training, but it never lasted very long at once. I tried using a stopwatch to time myself and tried to go as long as I could so I could figure out how long it took me before I started having anxiety attack symptoms. Unfortunately, that time is very short, lasting only about half an hour to 45 minutes. There were times when I would get to an hour, but I would be feeling pretty sick. Some of my symptoms were stomach pain, rapid heartbeat, and severe loss of concentration.

Today, I decided to and got an opportunity to do a long stretch of job related things. I decided to use the stopwatch again because I found out that was actually a technique that can control perfectionism alongside other ones, and didn’t want it becoming an issue again. This was also One of the first times I had a long stretch since my training and discovery of my job related perfectionism.

I expected to last an hour max, like I normally did.

Instead, I went over two hours with almost no anxiety related symptoms. The only problem I had with some mild frustration when I was reading a book about a career I was interested in but not understanding all of it, and even then, I never felt out of control. I even got what I want to do done that day in terms of job goals.

,Anxiety,"(I tagged this as NSFW for ED triggers and pregnancy triggers)

I’ve (20F) been underweight my whole life. I don’t have any desire to lose weight, but I’m sensitive to foods and eating. 

I’ve decided to eat more and regularly and for the first time since I was a child, I’m a healthy BMI/weight.

However, pregnancy is a huge fear of mine, and since I’ve gained weight my stomach has a slight pouch. My stomach is now a huge trigger of mine and I’ve been freaking out over possibly being pregnant for days now. 

The anxiety is irrational. I have an IUD and I’ve taken several pregnancy tests. I also have no pregnancy symptoms. But I keep freaking over being pregnant. My heart won’t stop beating, and I have a constant adrenaline rush.

I’m considering always using condoms from now on, but I feel like that won’t get rid of the anxiety either since it’s largely irrational. My partner worries that I’ll stop eating regularly to reduce the size of my stomach. I’m just not used to having a normal-sized stomach or not being underweight.

It just sucks that I should be celebrating gaining weight and being healthier, but my anxiety won’t let me. I’ve never been in panic mode for this long consistently.

,Anxiety,"I have no one to listen to my problems so I thought I would write them down. Then I decided to post it on here. 

Just moved to a new city and started at a new school. I don't miss anything from my old hometown, I'm actually quite happy to be somewhere else. Moving has been tough though. I had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends.

I have kind of 'joined' a group of friends at school. They're all pretty nice. The dynamic of the group is a little weird though. Its like 50% introverts who don't talk much, myself included, and 50% strongly opinionated extroverts. They mostly seem like a nice group of people though. In regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. Trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. It's hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. I feel like I'm being ungrateful because even though I think I've been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what I want, I still feel so shit.

I've never been diagnosed but I think I could have depression and/or anxiety. I would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but I don't want to tell my parents how I feel.

Over the past few years I've thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three times in my life. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. I've been researching pills I can get at a chemist that I could overdose on and I've found a suicide bridge that's very close to my house. I've been told that I should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments doesn't seem worth it sometimes.

I'm starting to find it hard to trust myself. I'm like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. During the brief moments when I feel happy about something I worry about my emotions causing me to do something I regret. When I'm sad or empty it's all I can think about.

There's this girl who's not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. She seems like a really nice person. We don't see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. I'm unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it's making me dizzy. I really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but I am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake I make. I feel kind of like It'll never happen, yet I spent the whole afternoon texting her. I feel like I'm going insane.

The people I admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you're always left wanting more from them. I aspire to be like this and make other people happy. I need to remember to smile more though.

Usually I have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non-existent. A month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and hasn't changed much, I think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the time. I just started waking up at 4am every morning out of nowhere and I can't stop. I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.

I feel so lonely. I just want someone to talk to and listen to. Getting to that point with someone new takes time and I'm getting kind of impatient.

I don't know what to do to make myself happy. If things worked out with this girl I think I would be happier, yet the thought of her losing interest in me makes me feel awful.

,Anxiety,"Sup guys. I've been having a right time of it trying to get out of bed to do anything at all. For the past few months, it's like anxiety has drained me of all of my energy, productivity, and organized thought processes. I've also developed social anxiety, so I've been staying at home most of the time, except for doctors' appointments. I barely go outside. I miss the outdoors and fresh air, but... The willpower is just not there. 

I'm currently trying to finish my final paper for college, but it's going real slow. Chores and stuff on my to-do list just aren't happening. Even things I enjoy doing, I can't find the energy to do. Going new places and having new experiences and meeting new people all used to be so exciting, but I haven't been able to muster up any interest or energy or bravery to do any of that for months.

I'm not looking for help, per se. I know what I have to do and I know it'll get better. But it doesn't FEEL like that, in the moment. It feels like I'm just wasting away. I feel guilty and lazy and it blows.

,Anxiety,"I'm really just using this as a way to vent and just let everything out. But if anyone has advice, it would really be greatly appreciated. This is a bit long, so bear with me.

I have always had anxiety, ever since I was a kid. I Was diagnosed sometime in elementary school (not particularly sure exactly when), and was put on fluoxetine (prozac). Oddly enough, during highschool I slowly stopped taking my meds, and now I don't take any at all. Havn't even done so in at least a year. I somehow managed to open up to my parents about this, and they really want me to take my meds (obviously). My mom has even gone through the lengths to give me some of hers (we take the same thing). 
I have recently started college, and now that I am over 18, I am too old for my previous psychiatrist. So, now I have no psychiatrist, and I only have my own old smelly pills, and the ones my mom gave me. She's been asking whether or not I have been taking them, and Ive been too scared to admit that I have not and lied about it.

Not only this, but academically, I am failing. Last semester, although I was honestly really depressed, I still tried and had a 2.4 GPA, which is pretty good. But this semester, even though I am no longer feeling as horribly depressed, I am doing so much worse academically. I calculated my GPA, and its at 1.6. I am failing 3 whole classes. For some reason, I have completely stopped doing my work. In one of my classes, I need 60 observation hours at a local elementary school, yet I was too scared to email the principle. It's too late to even start my hours fnow, and Im afraid to talk to my professor about it. And once again, I lied. My dad asked if I had gotten them started, and I said that I did. He was really proud of me, and I just feel like a piece of shit. I keep avoiding my work, and now I have started to avoid my classes altogether. I'm supposed to be in class right now, but I am too scared to go. 

I havn't really made any friends, and at this point I just don't want to be here. I want to be in college, and get a job (I'm hoping to be an early childhood teacher) but I'm starting to think that's not possible. I've lowkey given up.

I know I should go to the counseling center, since my university has free counseling for students, but (surprise, surprise!) i'm too scared to go. I've been planning on going since my first semester, but I always just ignore it.

,Anxiety,"Hello!

As a kid, I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( I believe this is the correct diagnosis, I was diagnosed when I was 8-9.) Aside from my blatantly obvious OCD and worrying all the time, I had an issue that still affects me today.

During times of high stress, for whatever reason, my mind is in a hyperactive state sometimes. As a kid, I would watch scary movies or read scary stories, and then my mind would psych myself up to the point where I would be worried that I would see a monster around the corner, so I would have siblings, parents or my dogs come with me to parts of the house such as the basement or the garage. Whenever I was around people, this completely went away and my mind was at ease. I always felt like a chicken afterward but I could feel the adrenaline when it was happening. I never saw anything my mind prepared me to see, nor did I have auditory hallucinations. Whenever it happens, I know it's irrational nevertheless I cannot calm myself down. 

Right before my parent's divorce, this went absolutely crazy. Whenever it was dark, I was frightened when I was alone. I couldn't go to the garage or downstairs alone. When my parents separated and I was in a low-stress environment for the first time in my life, it went away completely for probably a year. Now I'm in another stressful bout in life with my father who is always getting in fights with me, college, and a job I really don't like. Just as an example, I've really been reading up on aliens recently. I'm not a UFO freak nor have I ever claimed to see aliens or a UFO, but I find the topic fascinating. The downside is that this is what my brain uses against me in these episodes. When I wake up before sunrise to get ready for work, I am absolutely terrified to pull my car out of the garage and go outside when it's dark. I expect to look out my window and see an alien-looking back in at me, and I often keep my eyes open when washing in the shower. My entire morning getting ready I'm in fight or flight mode, but once I get to work and I'm around other people, I'm fine. When the sun comes up, this happens to a much lesser extent.

The same thing happens when I go to my basement. I rarely have to go down there. It's dark and colder than the rest of my house. Whenever I go down there, my brain instantly hypes me up and I prepare myself to beat up a monster or ghost or alien or whatever is around the corner, even though there never is one. I know that everything is fine and I'm alone, but I can't calm myself down during these episodes. I know I'm not going to encounter anything yet I'm still in a fight or flight mode.

I have been reading up on this and I am worried that maybe I have schizophrenia or psychosis. From what I've read, I don't have either of these because I recognize that my fears are irrational when they're happening as to believing them as a schizophrenic or psychotic would, although I'm still kind of questioning my own sanity here.

Tonight felt an attack coming on.  I had freaked myself out and the anxiety was ramping up fast and big league.  Picked up a weight and lifted for 30min or so.  Anxiety is very very reduced now, back to manageable levels.  Attack cancelled before it could peak.

The trick is to lift lite weights - not heavy.  This way you can lift for a lot longer and burn off all that anxious energy.  So I'll lift for 5 min or so, take a break for a few min, then lift more.  Don't lift to failure because then you can't keep lifting.

Even if you don't own weights you probably have something ""kind of heavy"" in your house.  Like a 2L or gallon of water.  Its not important that the weight is heavy, just important that it gets lifted a lot.

My manager is absurdly critical and hypocritical and unclear in what she wants to the point of making me ill and then insisted on like 4 meetings a week to ask how I am, even using the phrase ""if youre still anxious i dont underatand why you havent gone to the doctor yet?"" 

I just get so scared about moving and finishing everything here and setting it up there. My day is full of work and evenings full of job applications, this weekend we are doing a 3 hour drive to go and view 8 different properties...

Theres just so much to do that fills me with stress and anxiety, itll be fine when we move in almost every way and I have an emergency fund to be ok out of work for a while (though losing a chunk of that is one source of anxiety too)

I took two weeks off work to do job apps and relax and ended up gaming almost solidly purely for the escape, i couldnt concentrate and job apps and rejections have always been incredibly depressing in of themselves.

Start worrying if i am ever going to get another job.

,Anxiety,"I'll try and make this as concise and easy to read as possible 🙂

**My history:**

I'm a 30 yo guy and I generally have heightened anxiety on a daily basis. Growing up I was bullied (alot) because of being gay and as far as I can tell from therapy etc this has had a big bearing on who I am today. I've tried Lexapro and Zoloft in the past but they gave me alot of side effects so I stopped. My psych at the time said that I didn't really need meds and that they were only a 'crutch' for me. I've been doing CBT for the past couple of years (on and off) with some success but not massively. I have a great partner now but I'm still an anxious guy.

**My anxiety:**

I overthink and worry alot (whether its about my appearance, health, what other people think of me, how im coming across in social situations). I'm a perfectionist and do suffer with fluctuating moods. I guess you could say I'm a very sensitive guy too. I get VERY nervous public speaking or speaking in any group at all (even speaking 1:1 with people I'm afraid my voice will break). Weirdly enough I cannot pee in public (at a urinal) and I regularly have issues keeping an erection during sex. All pretty embarrassing for a 30 yo guy.

**My dry mouth:**

My biggest physical symptom is that I have a chronic dry mouth which really gets me down. It started 2 years ago after a number of panic attacks and it really hasn't gone away. It's ALWAYS on my mind. I've gone to numerous specialists who all told me it was anxiety related. The unfortunate thing is that anti-depressants (the SSRIs I tried) make it worse. I tried all the OTC stuff.

**My job:**

Outside of this I've been pretty successful in my career (I manage a team of 10 people in tech) and have worked across various high intensity roles.

The performance anxiety definitely holds me back and is one of the main reasons I'm writing this today. Everytime I have to speak in public (regardless of the size of the team) I feel so nervous. This never gets better even though I have presented hundreds if not thousands of times in my career to date.

**The future!**

,Anxiety,"EDIT: Sorry the post is a bit long, I wanted to be as detailed as possible

First, a little background on me, Im a 23 year old male and I have been suffering from depression and anxiety my whole life. The past couple years though, my anxiety has gotten absolutely terrible. I have a horrible time getting myself to even leave the house. I have really bad social anxiety. I have emetophobia (fear of throwing up). I have a bad stutter that has been off and on my whole life but of course, it is really bad right now as i'm going through this time my life. I feel like i'm scared of the world and I just want to stay to myself all the time but its leading me to become more depressed then i've ever been. I have this feeling that i'm not even a man, cause what kind of man is scared to leave the house or talk to people? It's shameful. My father passed away September then I lost my childhood cat in November which has led even more of a feeling of being trapped. I didn't have much of a relationship with my father and I really wish he was around now because I really think he would've been able to help me right now.

Now to yesterday, I was once again fed up with the way I was feeling so I decided that I was going to take action. I have tried exercise (although admiringly, I should do it more) and mediation to try to relieve my symptoms naturally but I haven't had any success. I wanted to try medication so I went on my insurance provider's website and saw that they have virtual office visits where they can prescribe antidepressants that aren't controlled substances. I made an appointment for two hours later and I was feeling so good, I felt like it was the beginning of everything getting better. I had a good conversation with the doctor and he prescribed me with 10mg lexapro daily. I went ahead and got the medication and took one right away. My impressions were that the effects of antidepressants were gradual but I can't say it went that way for me. Within 2 hours, I had the most severe anxiety I've had in a long time, my heart was pounding, I was sweating,  I had a headache, and of course the nausea. I got no sleep last night at all and started doing research on lexapro. Needless to say, im really really scared now. I saw all the stories that matched up with mine and I just don't think I can do it anymore. I think im gonna go back to trying to exercise the anxiety away. Im worried that the side effects are always gonna be to much for me. Im also worried about getting off of them when it comes time and the withdrawal that people report. I mean, if I can't handle getting on them, how am I gonna go through the withdrawal? It seems like it's going to be pretty much the same side effects.  Im sitting here with the same fog over my head since I took it last night, i'm really tired, slightly dizzy, and depressed. Im really starting to feel like there is no way out of this way of thought and i'm really scared.

I am really looking for any sort of advice from the community here. I've always had good luck with reddit, except for a few bad apples, and I figured this might be a good way to reach out for support. I am so torn on what to do with my prescription. I don't know if I want to keep taking it or not.

,Anxiety,"so i’ve recently (november) been diagnosed with social anxiety and bipolar 2, so of course i kinda get a little of both downs and ups. I’ve recently started grinding my teeth in my sleep and have nightmares every single night. This has been going on for the past year; I’m an artist and have very vivid dreams, and previously, I based a lot of my art on dreams I’ve had. But now, I’m uninspired and exhausted when I wake up. It’s not a recurring nightmare (except the ones about school but I’m just terrified of school) I actively look up what each dream means, and it’s nice to kinda get an idea of what my brain is trying to tell me, but it doesnt stop nightmares in general.

I’ve recently started grinding my teeth in my sleep and have nightmares every single night. This has been going on for the past year; I’m an artist and have very vivid dreams, and previously, I based a lot of my art on dreams I’ve had. But now, I’m uninspired and exhausted when I wake up. It’s not a recurring nightmare (except the ones about school but I’m just terrified of school) I actively look up what each dream means, and it’s nice to kinda get an idea of what my brain is trying to tell me, but it doesnt stop nightmares in general.

,Anxiety,"About 8 years ago my GP diagnosed me with an anxiety disorder (after severe panic attacks) and prescribed a low dose of Klonopin (.5mg) which I used only as needed. It was never a daily routine and having it greatly improved the qualify of my life. A 30 pill supply usually lasted about 2 months. 

This past fall my Dr. said that I was using the medicine too long and suddenly stopped the prescription. I tried to make the case with him that I was still on occasion dealing with acute anxiety episodes. He stopped refilling my prescription. I trust his medical advice and with the opiod crisis, I think he has become more conservative in his approach to prescribing. I told myself he knew better than I and tried to tough it out. Fortunately there was no withdrawal.

Since then I try hard to keep it in check. Yesterday was totally a waste, I couldn't get my work done. Unfortunately I find myself turning to alcohol nightly instead. Usually one or two drinks. Getting through the days have been hellish recently with the nervousness, tics, and uncontrollable talking to myself in public. Prolonged periods of anxiety cause depression in me which I'm really trying to avoid.

I want to go back onto benzodiazepenes. Should I try to find a Dr. specifically for this. I don't want to seem like I'm ""Dr. shopping"" nor do I want to use the black market to source them.

,Anxiety,"Hi,

First of all, I'm a hypochondriac and am especially afraid of having heart illnesses. I've been having numerous panic attacks since (again) a year now. It started in a very stressful phase and since then hasn't stopped. My heart pounds more strongly everyday, I feel it on my neck and I have these heart skips/early contractions.

Im working on my masters thesis and have to give it in in a couple of weeks. But I feel like I can't do this any longer. I have reached my absolute maximum when it comes to resisting stress. I am having these skips on a daily basis now, I have nausea, a faster heartbeat. It just feels so unhealthy, as if it was slowly killing me. I am literally waiting for the moment I get a heart attack. That's what I'm afraid of.

I don't know what to do. There is nothing that relaxes me as soon as I have just a bit of stress. I get several panic attacks, sometimes many a day.

I don't even know what concretely to ask for. I feel helpless and doomed. I will probably go to the cardiologist let it get checked. My previous doctors say I am fine, but one said I should do a long term ekg to see what and if something is going on.

Maybe, do you know how to actively relax? If you HAVE to work no matter what you are forced to be stressed. And whenever I have to work I cant relax for the whole day. I am also very afraid of the presentation, since presenting actively gives me these heartskips. I feel them when standing in front of the audience. Usually at the beginning. And since this time I am very anxious about the presentation, somehow I am afraid it will kill me.

I would appreciate some feedback or just anything. Maybe even personal experiences from similar situations.

,Anxiety,"Title kind of says it all.
 I (F 21) have panic disorder. Haven’t had a bad attack since last April, thought I was making progress. Had a good day but started driving on the freeway, fairly crowded, going 60 all of the sudden  a switch went off and I felt like I didn’t exist, the world felt weird, and I was going to die.
Had to pull of the nearest exit (almost pulled off on the freeway )sit for awhile call my mom and muster the courage to drive the rest of the way home (thankfully just back roads not the freeway)

 I (F 21) have panic disorder. Haven’t had a bad attack since last April, thought I was making progress. Had a good day but started driving on the freeway, fairly crowded, going 60 all of the sudden  a switch went off and I felt like I didn’t exist, the world felt weird, and I was going to die.
Had to pull of the nearest exit (almost pulled off on the freeway )sit for awhile call my mom and muster the courage to drive the rest of the way home (thankfully just back roads not the freeway)

,Anxiety,"Hi Reddit,

I personally don't have anxiety but my ldr girlfriend does and I want to be there for her but it's overwhelming me. I constantly trigger her anxiety and it is taking a toll on us as a whole. She constantly is pulling fights with me mainly problems and issues that I don't think are necessarily big such as videogames like overcooked, league of legends, portal, stardew etc... Speaking the truth about how I feel, spending time with my friends or if they tease her and me not making a bigger issue out of it, hypothetical situations such as spending vacations days with my friends instead of her. I don't remember the others but it goes from me not telling her enough things feelings etc when I feel I am. I have spoken up about this before and she tells me it is her anxiety that is causing it and she tells me I'm not being sympathetic and that I dismiss her feelings. So we decided to change my approach such asa always address her feelings first and foremost which is a completely reasonable thing then it became a problem of me giving her reassurance such as telling her how much I care and love so then I started doing that but it became not enough amount and quality wise even when I think I'm doing enough and the best  which is all genuinely how I feel about her. she doubts that it is true regardless. I can't take it anymore the constant interrogation, that feeling of not being enough, the endless bickering, and I was about to end things right then and there. Is there something I should bring up and discuss I told her all these things before and she just says sorry it's my anxiety I need more reassurance understanding etc.. but I'm starting to feel that we have not been spending any quality time together and enjoying our company and love but instead the relationship became me just constantly trying to fix myself and devoting myself to giving her all my attention reassurance and fighting over mundane issues for more than half of this relationship so far and it doesn't seem to end. The fights happens constantly everyday and sometimes multiple times a day that takes up all the time we spend together. It's been this way for weeks.

,Anxiety,"At this same time two years ago, I would go into work and be terrified for no reason. I work in a 24-hour watch office that is frequently manned by one individual, and when I would be on these solo shifts I would spend hours trying to psyche myself up to take care of the very small, very simple tasks I needed to complete throughout my shift. I would open up the word or excel document I needed to work on and stare at if for twenty minutes before my eyes flicked over to one of the numerous social media sites that I'm no doubt quite addicted to.

I would sit there, sweating, panicking, because ""Oh my god, why am I so useless, I just need to do this one stupid thing and I can't even do that, what is wrong with me"" until, having had days to work on a project, I'd hastily wrap it up with half an hour to go before the deadline.

It's finally over. I still procrastinate a bit, but no task ever consumes my mind like it used to.

What fixed it, for me, was a change in diet. I didn't change anything else really... my other probable contributing factors are still alive and well. I still don't have circadian rhythm of any kind (thanks a lot, shift work) I still don't exercise enough, I still sit for extended periods of time, I still drink a bit more than is probably healthy. In fact, I still don't even really eat all *that healthy.* But I felt the change in about three months, and after about six months it was manageable. In Eighteen months anxiety was a thing that rarely happened, and now its been two years and I'm basically done with all the anxiety I used to have. It's like being a completely different person.

,Anxiety,"Hi all!

So to start, I'm in a very happy and healthy relationship \[M23\] with my \[F21\]. We are both decently fit and very attractive people. Our sex life has been great up until last week when I couldn't get it up. I did my three night shifts, we hung out again and all was good; for only 2 days. On the 3rd day it came back again. We talked and she gets it and understands I need time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I have a bit of performance anxiety. I know she likes daily sex and so I feel bad when I can't pleasure her because I also like daily sex. But its like my body / mind just isn't driven as wild lately. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's been drama with my roommate, I have a new job coming up, I currently work nights, and drink tons of caffeine. I'm going to start meditating before and after bed, drink only one cup and see if this helps. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get this hot feeling in my chest and can't perform when it is time. I believe there is too much stress in my life but I haven't had this before. Any ways that people cope and deal with this in the long term, so I may have the skills to continue doing what I love?

But if all of us could take a moment before we immediately get hurt by what someone says to step back and question why they&amp;#39;ve said it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is free to change the world. I think all of us have the super power to make this planet into the beautiful kind one we all imagine. Please take the time to reach out, you never know who you might save.&lt;/p&gt;

Last Saturday I had a one night stand with a girl I found on Tinder. We both got quite shitfaced and ended up at my apartment, and we had unprotected sex.

\- I do not produce pre-cum (at least not that I'm aware of) and if I were, as stupid as It sounds, I'm doing the r/nofap thing and have been doing it for the last month.

I am overall feeling OK (not ill).

Today when I came to work, out of nowhere I felt a vibration kind of feeling in the middle of my chest (below my heart) when breathing in and out. I kind of feel it when in the middle of inhaling/exhaling, not during the whole inhaling/exhaling process.

,Anxiety,"For a long time, I've found it really difficult to turn off my mind and not overthink literally any situation. Regardless of how minor each of these situations might have been, such as a slightly ""weird"" comment that others wouldn't even care about, I end up analysing them in great detail. And in each case, my thought process arrives at the same conclusion: I should not have said anything and everyone most likely can't stand me.

I'm also convinced that no one likes me, despite the fact that I don't actually have any concrete evidence of the contrary. I think the worst part is, I know how irrational that sounds, but I always end up relapsing into that negative mindset. For instance, if I know that there's a party, but I wasn't invited, my mind will automatically assume the worst: that no-one likes me and that's why I didn't receive the invite. Mind you, I might've not necessarily said yes, but not receiving the invite brings out my fear of not being accepted by everyone. 

In addition, people talking in whispers or laughing when I'm around genuinely frightens me because I then believe that they must be talking about me or laughing at me. It bums me out and I'll end up spending a fair bit of time trying to work out what they were talking about. That ends up taking me down many different hypothetical scenarios that are most likely not at all true. 

I honestly hate what I put myself through on a daily basis. It can completely ruin my day and put me in a bad mood. 

To put the icing on the cake, I'm pretty sure I have self-esteem issues. I get very uncomfortable (more than the average person) when I receive compliments and will usually attempt to counter them e.g. ""I'm not really that smart"" or ""I didn't really do anything there"". My internal thoughts are often harsher and somewhat condescending of myself. I don't know if there's necessarily a link between social anxiety and self-esteem issues, but I thought I'd just get this off my chest.

,Anxiety,"TLDR: i need help navigating the student health bureaucracy at my school, should I try to see a general physician about my anxiety?

After a long internal battle, I finally decided to confront my anxiety. 
I am currently a student with student healthcare plan so I am limited to my school’s “mental health services” or “medical services”. Mental health service center is staffed with people with various titles such as psychologist, psychiatrist, and psychotherapist, with various degrees such as MD, PhD, PsyD. While medical service center is like a primary health provider staffed with physicians and nurses. 

I went with mental health service center and they first do a initial consult over the phone consisting of one of the staff asking about my mental health needs and asking some follow up questions and precautionary questions such as if I’m suicidal. I got the impression from the phone call that I was deemed not an emergency so I was referred to “student wellness”, another branch of “student health services”. I enjoyed meeting the wellness expert, we’ve had useful discussions about mindfulness, thinking patterns etc. but I do not think he is capable to treating anxiety as he is PhD and would not be able to diagnose or treat me if there was a need. 

My main goal of seeking help is to get an accurate diagnosis of my anxiety and go from there. I feel like I have generalized anxiety disorder with perhaps depression or ADHD. However I will not get any of the answers on my current course.

Has anyone had similar issues in navigating the student health bureaucracy?

,Anxiety,"TW for talk of suicide.

I’m typing this on mobile and totally freaking out so I’m really sorry if this is badly written or not the right place. I don’t know where else to go. Every day since I was a teen, just one panic attack after the next. I’m 22 and haven’t had a semblance of a life.

I can’t eat, sleep, or enjoy anything. I’ve tried therapy and I exercise regularly and when I do eat, I keep it healthy and nourishing. I drink lots of water, no caffeine. I tried yoga and meditation and supplements and CBD. I tried all sorts of meds and I turned into a benzo addict and nearly died during withdrawals so I don’t want to go back on any pharmaceuticals for my own safety since I have an addictive personality. Years and years and so much money and time just wasted. 

There’s no end to this. I feel cursed.

I feel like I’m constantly having a heart attack. Shaking, headaches, dizziness, chest pains, throwing up all the time.

I’m struggling to find a job due to this and having autism and my bf resents me for making him pay for everything since we live together and I absolutely hate myself for it. 

I put in so much time and effort to get a job. Phones calls, interviews, applications. I dread all of it to the point where it’s all I think about. I know it’ll happen soon enough but I’ve had jobs before and I know it will only make things worse. It’s like there’s no escape. I’m considering suicide just to make the adrenaline stop.

I feel fucking crazy. Nobody believes me or understands how bad this has gotten for me. I feel the need to hide it so nobody thinks I’m faking to get out of responsibilities.

I have no idea what to do anymore. I just want to die. This isn’t a life at all, it’s hell and I want out. I can’t imagine being alive another year feeling this sick from nervousness with no friends because I’m terrified of people, grinding for money in a job I hate just to stay alive, a relationship that I’m ruining because I’m so dumb, and no passion for anything.

&lt;p&gt;I can’t eat, sleep, or enjoy anything. I’ve tried therapy and I exercise regularly and when I do eat, I keep it healthy and nourishing. I drink lots of water, no caffeine. I tried yoga and meditation and supplements and CBD. I tried all sorts of meds and I turned into a benzo addict and nearly died during withdrawals so I don’t want to go back on any pharmaceuticals for my own safety since I have an addictive personality. Years and years and so much money and time just wasted. &lt;/p&gt;

For about 10 years now I've been struggling with anxiety dreams where I ""wake up"" but can't tell that I'm not in a dream anymore.

I was only in the stage crew but I became overwhelmed with anxiety about getting stuck on stage while the curtains opened, or ruining something for one of the actors. I started sleep walking frequently when I got particularly anxious . The worst one was right before a show, I was dreaming that the curtains were opening and I got stuck on the set behind a fake door. It was very dark and I didn't know what was going on, I kept feeling around for the knob so i could get out but felt clothes. I finally found the door knob and then realized I was standing inside my own bedroom closet. I was embarrassed for myself.

,Anxiety,"hey, everyone.

i’ve [23f] been diagnosed w gad, sad, and mdd for a few years now.

the depression only comes when the anxiety’s really bad, but most days, i’ve been doing okay.

even though i’ve had my anxiety disorder diagnosis for years now, it’s still really difficult for me to accept.

it’s just that.. i’ve lived a good life. i was never close w my family besides my sister, but at least i had her. i went to a good university, and dated some guys. granted, my last ex was physically and emotionally abusive, but all in all, i made it through, graduated, moved out and got a full-time job in my field. i was even blessed enough to have found someone who genuinely loves me.

so why am i like this? lol

why won’t it go away?

i feel like i have it so good compared to other people, but i get so anxious to the point of chest pain. my muscles will lock in place sometimes while i’m walking, and i have to stop, or i’ll trip. my hair falls out excessively, luckily it’s not noticeable since i have such thick hair lol but it’s because i get such bad headaches/stomach pain from the anxiety that i pull at my hair a lot to distract myself from the pain.

i feel like i have no reason to be this way, and that i’ve gotten so far from my lowest points in life, but

,Anxiety,"Hi I'm 15 I had a pretty normal childhood I grew up on a dairy farm when my mum and dad were 5 minutes down the road then we moved and still did a bit of dairy farming but the stress was too much so we bought a house in the local town I met my best friend in 2016 and as of December 2019 she decided to treat me like a piece of shit and left me when I was at my worst.
 But I'll begin at the start.
In 2019 my mum started to work 30 minutes away from where we lived, she left at 7:30am and came back at 5:30pm that started to make me worry because there are alot of tourists on the road she drives on so I started to worry about ""what if she crashes?"" ""what if the bridge breaks and she can't come home?""  in August it ended up making me worry 24/7 that effected my school work so I didn't go to school my best friend was treating me like shit and the exams were coming up and all I wanted to do was cry and spend time with mum. I ended up getting counselling and I went back to school passed 2 exams but failed 2 aswell. Now fast forward to October, I got woken up by my dad at 4am to tell me ""granny is really sick your going up to the hospital with mum"" the hospital was 1 hour flight away we were driving to the airport and we got the message that she sadly passed away. The last time I saw her was December 2018. When we came back home my mum and dad started fighting because my dad wasn't being the best person and wanted to help my mum when she told him she didn't want help they started fighting alot and that lead to me having panic attacks. Fast forward again to December it was the end of the school year and my mum and brother went to my grannys resthome to sort through her things, that was very emotional for her and she was very busy so she couldn't call me. The Sunday night my mum got home, that day I wasn't feeling good at all and she came home and my dad flipped out because apparently it was my mums fault because she didn't call me and I was scared, mad and upset when my dad flipped out. I haven't been right since that weekend. Plus I went on school camp a week before school ended and I was sick when I got home I did some stuff I'm not proud of and that made my anxiety worse. I'm now struggling to get out of the house without hiding behind mum. All my anxiety made me think I was bi (even though I'm not), made me think about the past and judge myself because of everything I've done in the past that I regret.

,Anxiety,"This is just a general rant as I’m having a pretty shitty week and I just need to vent and hopefully get an internet hug or two.

I work as a dog walker, running my own business. I haven’t been enjoying my job for a while and have put some plans into motion to start a new business but they’re going to take a few months to get up and running. I’ve just found out that the recent increasing pain in my knee is because the cartilage is eroding and my whole knee is out for alignment so I’m probably going to need an operation that will put me off work for at least 2 months and basically kill my current business. So I’m worried about my health and my income.

I have more then enough savings to keep me going at the minute luckily BUT... my landlady just told me she’s putting the house on the market. Now it may take months to sell so it may not be an immediate problem. But I’ve been looking online and I can’t find anything else local to rent in my price range, particularly if I’m not working. I have enough savings that in theory I can rent a flat of my own and pay all the bills for about 3-4 years without working (very healthy savings account!) but I’m struggling to pass the referencing checks because I’m self employed and have an ‘inconsistent’ income. I also don’t want to use too much of my savings as that is my ‘house deposit’ fund for once I get a more consistent income and can get a mortgage.

I just want to get a place of my own, or even another room in a shared household if the people are nice, and be able to take a couple of months to focus on my health and sorting out my long term career plans.

I feel like I can’t focus on any one problem at the moment. If I sort my job I can easily afford to rent a flat or buy a small house of my own. But my health is lousy at the moment and I may not have any income. I’m in an incredible amount of pain from my knee and also a shoulder injury. I just feel like I’m in a fog and I want to curl up and sleep until the pain goes away.

I have options I know. My landlady may take months to sell. I have family/friends I can fall back on though I hate being a burden. If I’m not working then I’m not tied to this area and could move somewhere cheaper but don’t want to go too far from friends/family.

Like... When i hang out with my bf sometimes i get anxious. My thoughts start to come really fast and i worry mostly about love.. I worry sometimes if something is okay to say, to do or how to even be! Like.. I overthink.. When i get these thoughts and feelings its hard to manage them. I worry if i truly love him.. Like i wont always feel all lovey dovey around him but i just worry... 
I worry if i truly love him cause i dont wanna hurt him  or like use him or anything bad, im also perfectionist in relationships sooo i overthink my feelibgd, my thoughts etc..

Im not sure what to do and where these worries even come... Or i may have some ideas.. Like this is my the first in real life relationship and its much more different than dating online so i have no experience whats its like to be in real life relationship. 

I think i really like him. Like before we started dating each other we were really good bffs and i loved him several months before dating

My anxiety have been pretty hard on me again ig.. Especially sometimes when i hang out with my bf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like... When i hang out with my bf sometimes i get anxious. My thoughts start to come really fast and i worry mostly about love.. I worry sometimes if something is okay to say, to do or how to even be! Like.. I overthink.. When i get these thoughts and feelings its hard to manage them. I worry if i truly love him.. Like i wont always feel all lovey dovey around him but i just worry... 
I worry if i truly love him cause i dont wanna hurt him  or like use him or anything bad, im also perfectionist in relationships sooo i overthink my feelibgd, my thoughts etc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im not sure what to do and where these worries even come... Or i may have some ideas.. Like this is my the first in real life relationship and its much more different than dating online so i have no experience whats its like to be in real life relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I quit my most recent job about a month ago, and have been subsisting on savings ever since. I have just enough savings to pay my bills for March and April's rent, and that's it. I quit without another job lined up because I had to leave from there. It was a negative environment, and I had enough in savings at the time where I had time to search for jobs. Well that was a month ago, I need to work in order to keep on subsisting. But I cant get a job without running a high risk of getting sick. I had put in an application at a pizza place near where I live. It's not a high paying job by any means, but is a means of fast money. It's by a university. Well, a suspected coronavirus carrier from China went there when he was supposed to self quarantine. He wasnt confirmed, they didnt test him. But that job option has been taken off the table. And now as cases have started appearing in my city, any job that involves working with the public has become increasingly risky. I wanted to do uber but now that isnt at option. I can, but I greatly increase my risk of getting sick. 

My family comes for visits, my mother usually bringing a lot of anxiety about this virus being in the city and how I should avoid this and avoid that, and stock up on disinfectants. And then at the same time they start asking me if I have a job. And since I'm unemployed, they try to provide a lot food wise, which I appreciate, but that is something my mom was doing before the virus. There's nothing wrong with helping your son out here and there, or bringing a cake you baked, but if I let her have her way, she would supply me with 100 percent of all my groceries. Against my will. I wouldn't have any say over what goes into the fridge I pay for or the cupboards I pay for. It would be her own choices that she would force on me, or guilt trip me for not accepting. 

Dont get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with helping your son out. Theres nothing wrong with bringing something occasionally, maybe something you cooked you'd like me to try, or a box of cookies. I dont have anything against that. But with regard to rations, since it is my place, I would prefer that I come to my parents house and ask, is it okay if I have this? If you have an extra loaf of bread, is it okay if I have it? And only doing so until i get back to normal. There is nothing wrong with that. But that isnt what happens. She comes and brings bag load after bag load of groceries, of things that she thinks I need, and forces them upon me. It doesn't make me feel good about that, I thank her nonetheless. Absolutely no amount of please stop, please dont do this, I dont like it when you this makes her stop. I spoke to her on the phone for an hour and a half yesterday about this very fucking thing, after months of explaining, and today she came and did the same. Also, when I first got my apartment, my mother started telling me to break my lease, because moving out would cause the family health insurance plan to increase. But I'm 23, once I turn 25 it will increase by the same amount whether I live at home or not. She got me thinking that it would be selfish to not break it. Eventually I decided, no fuck it. I'm keeping my lease. Now, because of this outbreak, only 3 months after moving out, she's telling me that I will be needing to move back home because if the situation gets out of hand than it's safer to live together. And that I cant afford it. 

It frustrates me to the core, and always leaves me reeling. And now this fucking virus is the excuse that sancitifies it. Because every visit is filled with a bloody fucking combination of everything I dangerous, and why aren't you working. And I dont want her suggestions because that is connected to a lot of negative sentiments associated with her manipulative suggesting of the past.

And since I&amp;#39;m unemployed, they try to provide a lot food wise, which I appreciate, but that is something my mom was doing before the virus. There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with helping your son out here and there, or bringing a cake you baked, but if I let her have her way, she would supply me with 100 percent of all my groceries. Against my will. I wouldn&amp;#39;t have any say over what goes into the fridge I pay for or the cupboards I pay for. It would be her own choices that she would force on me, or guilt trip me for not accepting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dont get me wrong, there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with helping your son out. Theres nothing wrong with bringing something occasionally, maybe something you cooked you&amp;#39;d like me to try, or a box of cookies. I dont have anything against that. But with regard to rations, since it is my place, I would prefer that I come to my parents house and ask, is it okay if I have this? If you have an extra loaf of bread, is it okay if I have it? And only doing so until i get back to normal. There is nothing wrong with that. But that isnt what happens. She comes and brings bag load after bag load of groceries, of things that she thinks I need, and forces them upon me. It doesn&amp;#39;t make me feel good about that, I thank her nonetheless. Absolutely no amount of please stop, please dont do this, I dont like it when you this makes her stop. I spoke to her on the phone for an hour and a half yesterday about this very fucking thing, after months of explaining, and today she came and did the same. Also, when I first got my apartment, my mother started telling me to break my lease, because moving out would cause the family health insurance plan to increase. But I&amp;#39;m 23, once I turn 25 it will increase by the same amount whether I live at home or not. She got me thinking that it would be selfish to not break it. Eventually I decided, no fuck it. I&amp;#39;m keeping my lease. Now, because of this outbreak, only 3 months after moving out, she&amp;#39;s telling me that I will be needing to move back home because if the situation gets out of hand than it&amp;#39;s safer to live together. And that I cant afford it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It frustrates me to the core, and always leaves me reeling. And now this fucking virus is the excuse that sancitifies it. Because every visit is filled with a bloody fucking combination of everything I dangerous, and why aren&amp;#39;t you working. And I dont want her suggestions because that is connected to a lot of negative sentiments associated with her manipulative suggesting of the past. Like all these valid fucking sentiments, of valid ficking experiences and now having to be brushed under the rug of this issue. It makes me want to go outside and just scream. That is how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

In the past I was cheated on many times and have carried some anxiety about being cheated on over to my new relationship but it never effected me until recently.
We recently became long distance when I moved to university,however due to him being in third year he is now busy a lot and I have averaged seeing him twice in the past two months.We have had a few issues long distance and have spoken about breaking up but always end up never doing it.
He doesn’t talk to me as much which I don’t mind I understand his busy but not seeing him much has made me feel disconnected and with some other dodgy goings on has made me obsessed with the fact he might be cheating .

I found out that on nights out my bf had been adding girls on Instagram (then liking all their recent photos ),I confronted him and he said he was in a group and they just got chatting and all added each other 
But I couldn’t get my head round how this could be the case (when I’m out I don’t even talk to the opposite sex enough to add them on social media ).anyway he agreed to stop ....

Again I was left thinking if that’s all it was he wouldn’t get that defensive .
I don’t know what to do because I’m very open with him that he has broken my trust slightly and that I now find it harder to trust him.
I feel like I’m going crazy because I’ve started doing unhealthy things like looking who his followed on insta recently which I’ve never done before ans I know is obsessive and only causes me to worry more .
It’s starting to get to me so much I make myself ill with worry and am ready to end the relationship over it because I cannot deal with the fear of thinking his cheating or being cheated on .

If he does have the virus (probably doesn’t, I’m overthinking) and my family gets it, my brother has diabetes and I’m worried that nobody seems to care that he’s at risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really can’t relax. I’ve been so paranoid for ages now. I cant even talk to a counsellor about it. Anyone got any tips to help calm down when you’re by yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"(EU) So a bit long winded, I will try however to just sum up.

Suffered with anxiety in the past (was diagnosed as generalised) I medicated for a couple of years and overcame things. This was about 7/8 years ago.

So I’m 30 now, 3 months ago, took a heart palpitation, first ever, which brought on a panic attack, also first ever, genuinely scary as hell. 

So as a precaution went to docs, sent to hospital, bloods done, ECG etc all came back fine but ever since that night I’ve constantly been in my head about the palpitations and the panic attack, now the panic I can somewhat control before it goes full panic attack but as soon I start worrying (and googling) about palpitations... I get them. Every single day. Constantly checking my pulse, obsessing really.

Finally went to the doctors two weeks ago and said I felt it was in my head, like I was causing the physical symptoms, she agreed because of my history and because tests have reported normal healthy male. 

She prescribed me 40mg propranolol. Take once daily.  When I feel the palpitations/panic coming on.

First two nights they worked amazing. Now they do seem to calm my heart down but my head still goes overdrive with thoughts and worry and I still end up having almost mini attacks due to the propranolol stopping my body fully reacting. I will just add in that my blood pressure, cholesterol, weight are average for my age, to rule that out.

,Anxiety,"So I was having a productive day today doing university work from home (I'm a masters student), and my flatmate comes home and tells me she's invited the guy she's seeing over for dinner.

I think 'Ok cool', I start to feel a bit nervous about meeting this guy, just small things like how should I introduce myself? 'friend', 'flatmate' etc. etc, nothing too serious.

Then I stop working and things start to get hazy, background sounds fade out around me and seem far away, I start to wonder what I'm actually doing with my life, why nobody likes me, why _I_ don't have someone coming over for dinner. My stomach hurts, I feel like crying, I lie on my bed doing absolutely nothing. She asks me if I want anything from the shop, I manage a 'No thanks'. I feel horrific, I want to die, just get out of the flat and go anywhere, escape from this life.

Suddenly this guy knocks at the door and snaps me out of it. I realise it's been 2 hours and I've just been spinning around in my own head listing all the things I hate about myself and how I'm so ugly (and worse that I won't go into here).

So I think I just had some kind of anxiety attack?? I've been under an incredible amount of stress lately, this week has been the most stressful of my life I think. It feels like a game of jenga, and my flatmate telling me this guy is coming was a final piece that sent the whole thing crumbling.

He's still here now as I'm typing this, they're laughing have a glass of wine - in the back of my mind it's obvious he'll stay the night and I'll have to listen to them gettin busy in the room next door - this upsets me even more, it reminds me again that I'm shit at relationships, and have been all my life.

Sooooo I basically just needed to type this out, it's given me something to focus on while they're busy having fun, and I frankly feel a bit better having written this - I can't focus on anything else at the moment.

But for some reason, I can't help but think that one day she's going to just suddenly realize I'm not good enough for her and break up with me out of the blue.

,Anxiety,"Background: I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADHD-inattentive type. I am currently on wellbutrin, Zoloft, vyvanse, and ativan (As needed). I was diagnosed almost 10 years ago. Therapy on and off- currently been doing therapy consistently for a year now.

Today while I was at my therapy appointment, my therapist had made a comment about how it seemed my anxiety was just always running. I have always joked that I have high functioning anxiety, but our conversation made me see that I think im more anxious than I ever thought.

It came up when I talked about always having a fear of my house being broken into or kidnapped when I am home alone. I have always had this fear for as long as i remember- but there is no trigger (nothing that i remember happened when i was younger to cause it) and the fear has never gotten better nor worse. This fear doesn't send me into a panic attack, I know that it is irrational and the probability is low, nor do i feel any physical symptoms associated with being anxious. I can usually push the thought away but will come back up randomly.

She also told me that the way I plan for stuff so far in the future- like in 8 years when I leave my current job, these are probably going to be the situations I'm dealt with and this is how I am going to handle it- is also anxiety. I know that not everyone is as future orientated as I am, but I didn't know that it wasn't normal to do this.

When I left therapy, I started thinking about this more, and I wonder how much of my habits or thought patterns etc is actually NOT normal, and is a result of my anxiety.

**Has anyone else experienced things like this? That you are just constantly anxious that it just feels normal, and you forget that most people DON'T feel like this or experience this?**

Makes me wonder what ""functioning"" feels like without the anxiety aspect.

Also, has anyone ever felt like you are never going to overcome your anxiety? I always try ""talking to my anxiety"" and telling myself its just the anxiety, trying to do breathing exercises, visual exercises, muscle relaxation blah blah blah. None of it works for long.... Like no matter what, there is just always a little nagging feeling in the back of my head. **Any suggestions outside of the normal therapy ""go-to"" ideas to help?**

,Anxiety,"   I've been forgetting stuff alot lately due to lack of sleep, not paying attention and depression. But somehow I'm CONVINCED that I have Alzheimer's disease. I'm 16 yr old by the way so that doesn't make ANY logical sense. I know I don't have it &amp; dimentia doesn't even run in my family. But my anxiety just kind of takes over sometimes, and I would start freaking out whenever I forget specific names or numbers. I'm sorry If I sound stupid (i probably am), and I apologise for wasting anyone's time reading this rant. 

   So I also listened to this album collection called ""The Caretaker, Everywhere at the End of Time"". It's about 6 hours long and I wouldn't recommend it if you have anxiety. It's basically the disease in music form and it's progression. I couldn't sleep for 3 days after that. The music was so chilling, it's almost like listening to someone's brain decompose slowly. That's probably what started this fear. 

   I don't have a therapist and I never told anyone about my mental issues. Going to a psychiatrist is kind of a taboo here and even if you get an appointment, mental hospitals are usually known for treating alcohol addiction. I'm sure there are trained professionals out there but I can't tell my family about my mental health. I won't. And never will.

,Anxiety,"Hi everyone, as I'm writing this I'm feeling really crushed by the latest events. Before all the news and facts about the coronavirus spreading I spent a couple awful months because of anxiety and everything related, as I was experiencing an important event in my life that stressed me out badly. After that, I was hoping I could get a time to heal and move on, but during this time it seems a bit hard because there is always more bad news coming (I live in Europe) and sometimes I feel triggered even though I'm cool. During the last nights I always went to bed with chest pain, palpitations and so on. Also, I feel te need to cry to feel a little lighter.
A couple of nights ago I was talking to my closest friend (which knows my condition) and reached out to her, telling her I needed to distract myself from all the virus related news. She, instead, started picturing apocalypse-scenarios and making jokes about the facts that most of us are gonna die and so on, she was being ironic but she was also serious. Even though I have anxiety, I am a rational person and I know how to take jokes, of course. But I felt like she could be a little softer this time and change the subject, like I asked.

Today I talked to my mom, and told her about this episode and also about the fact that today I went to therapy, like every week, and that I felt better.
She reacted in a way that really shook me. I told her that the way my friend behaved left me a little disappointed, and she started telling me the most awful things.
First, she told me that my anxiety about the virus is not rational (btw, I'm not scared, I'm just a bit crushed by all the bad news/feelings about this, which are everywhere). Second, she started yelling that I am not reacting in any way to it, that I'm not doing anything, which is not true but okay. Third, she told me that all I'm doing is making things worse, that my mind is doing everything and it is not possible to going on like that. Also, she thinks my anxiety is not real and that I use it as an excuse to hide.
I really felt sick. Over the summer I had the worst time ever, and for weeks I couldn't go out or I would feel sick because of anxiety. She didn't care/understand, and started yelling that I was being dramatic. Also, my father (my parents are divorced) doesn't know about any of this, yet one day told me that people who suffer from anxiety are weak and coward.

I try so hard to make improvements and to feel better. I was starting to feel better after the hardest months AND without using meds. I was really proud of myself. The fact that, most of the time, my progress doesn't show on the outside, even though it is huge, doesn't mean it's not there.
Also, I never project my anxiety onto other people, nor I vent daily to them. Most of the times it is just me suffering by myself.
I feel lonely. I am being judged for EVERYTHING. Wrong, right... It doesn't matter. I cannot vent, I cannot tell stuff that happen in my life, I cannot say anything. I'm being held accountable for whatever happens and I'm SO tired. I just want to be understood and encouraged and loved. Am I such a terribile human being?! I don't understand.
I am not happy. I would rather face this completely by myself and far from where I am right now. I'm tired.

,Anxiety,"So I've been on anxiety medication for over a year now. But a few months ago my estranged father took me off insurance so I've been having to wait to get insured by medicaid. Maybe it's because I haven't been to a therapy session in months, or maybe it's because I think my recently cut hair looks stupid (which I hate thinking because it's such a stupid, superficial thing to worry about), but my self esteem has hit an all-time low for the year. 

Yesterday was a real beat down. I went to my philosophy club at my college to talk about a short story but I was way too nervous to say anything.

So I didn't even get to explain what I was thinking. It made me incredibly furious but I couldn't show it because I didn't want to come off as a jerk. I ended up going home feeling defeated.

,Anxiety,"
I find myself at a crossroads and could use a hand on my next move. Currently, I’m overly anxious about all aspects of life. For the past ten years or so I’ve made little friends and was ashamed of myself for things that I am coming to find out happened to me in the past. I unfortunately projected this onto relationships including my sons. I live with this fact everyday and it hurts. A lot. I’m tired of feeling this way, I’m tired of overthinking, I’m tired of always being in a bad mood and not pleasant to be around, and I’m tired of not knowing who I am, what my thoughts are, and what I believe in. I fold tremendously when challenged about any and every aspect of my life and I’m come off as pompous and arrogant. I am ready for a change 

I’m not centered within myself. I don’t say what I want and don’t mean what I say out of fear of rejection, fear of looking stupid, or fear of coming off as arrogant and knowing more than I think I do. All mistakes I’ve made in the past that I tormented my self for. I have a very negative self image and while I seem very confident on the outside-I’m so scared and terrified that I’m not living in the present moment. This causes me to overthink and over analyze every detail causing me to miss obvious things about life and induces self-hate. I would really enjoy putting in the work for myself to really understand who I am. I am reading Codependent No More, journaling every morning, practicing mindfulness every morning, exercising, eating ok, and taking care of myself. But the pain from my most recent break up is still very much there, and I am so anxious still. I am seeking medication from a Psychiatrist for the short term so I can create some headspace and dig deep. 

On the other hand, maybe I’m missing community, friends, and a safe space to be me and not be judged. I am starting to tour churches as a potential start to be involved in the community and to at least get my son an Idea of religion. I have a very negative view on religion (childhood issues) but I’m willing to at least try. My issues is if I’m not centered in myself and potentially easily impressionable, I may find myself being pushed to do things I really don’t want to do. But, I’ve been such a recluse that I don’t want to do anything and remain dormant. So I suppose I’m conflicted.

I am nearly 3 years into recovery from a sever psychotic episode. I am pretty much fine but do suffer with the odd spell of anxiety/panic attacks .

We’ve been planning this for weeks and it’s a nightmare finding a time we’re both free. When we meet it will be at least 5 hours after taking 2mg, would I be stupid to have 2 or 3 beers?

I know it would be fine to go and not to drink but I don’t want to have the conversation as to why I’m not drinking and I’m a crap liar. I would also hate that a very brief panic attack has had an impact on my social life.

So i've had bad back pain and abdominal pain for a while.  I knew I had anxiety about these things but didn't think it was the main issue.  Finally I came to the realization that it was really the anxiety that was causing these issues more than the actual ailments itself.  

My doctor gave me cipralex and after two days I woke up in the night with a bad panic attack, the worst I've had.  It also seemingly gave me bad heartburn but it's possible I'm imagining it.  Ever since I've woken up almost every night with anxiety/heartburn.  Sometimes I'm able to go back to sleep pretty quickly like twenty minutes and sometimes it takes an hour or two.  

It's pretty annoying cause I've had this for like 3 weeks and I never had any problems before I took the medication.  I also have more general anxiety during the day, but I've learning some strategies that help that, but no luck on the night stuff really. I mean yes some luck, I am not as anxious when I wake up as I was at first, but I still wake up every night between 12-3 and I'd love for that to stop.

I can't easily study in the first place without feeling this weight on my chest and it's difficult to actually be able to sit all the way through and finish a task cause most of the time I just I am too anxious or panicking if i spend too long .

,Anxiety,"TDLR; Thought everything was going well but was actually overworking myself, had a breakdown in December, got put on medication which scares me, stuck in China during the Coronavirus with health anxiety and stomach issues. Please give me any advice, comfort, kick up the ass you have.

Hi, this may be a long one, so strap in. Also I'm new, so please be gentle if I get anything wrong.

For some context, I graduated from uni back in 2018 and made a big move to China that August. I've been aware that I've had anxiety before (and it was fairly mild/triggered by things I could control) and coming back to the university that I studied abroad in to work as an intern wasn't scary at all. It was like coming home! I've now been here for one and a half years (not including my time in exchange) and love it.

From August 2018,  I was faced with living abroad for an extended amount of time for the first time, dealing with a big friend group, finding my footing as a member of staff rather than a student, living with people other than my family, and realising I was bisexual and beginning a relationship.

Back in June 2019, I started to get some stomach issues and was faced with anxiety surrounding nausea. I put it down to the heat of south China (something I've not dealt with before) and my lack of routine when traveling in South Korea. I actually look back now and realise that I had a minor panic attack on the subway in Seoul, which impacted how I felt when traveling alone.

Returning back in August 2019, my partner decided to move to Spain so in order to fill up my time that used to be spent with them, I took on more work. I decided to work part time in another section of the university, look into doing a masters degree, get my TEFL certificate, and help with various other tasks in the department. I was so stressed about finding what I was going to do after this year that I ended up having to go to hospital for an irritated nerve in my brain (thankfully calmed down since) and decided to slow down a little.

On the surface, I was having a wonderful time. I adore my colleagues and my roommates, I went out for dinners, I had fun at work - although I was exhausted at the end of everyday, I was really just living so happily.

The one thing that was in the back of my mind and increasingly becoming more of an issue was my stomach problems. I wasn't controlling what I ate but meal times were no longer a source of enjoyment for me - they became periods of time where all I could think was ""This is going to cause me indigestion later."" or ""I'm going to feel so nauseous when I go to bed."" It became consuming and frustrating. I started to think that I was going to deal with this forever.

Back in December, my laptop broke. I spilt water on it and I was freaking out. I knew I could afford to buy a new one (and probably was due a new one) but since I still had no plans for what I was going to do after this year of my internship and had a winter trip coming up, the looming problem of a whole paycheque being lost due to my carelessness was too much.

On Christmas Day, I spent time alone watching Christmas movies and then went out to dinner with my friends. It was a lovely day, although I felt anxious about going out to eat with my stomach and nausea problems, I still enjoyed. But that night I woke up around 1am with chest pains, I texted my partner and decided to try to go back to sleep. But I couldn't, I started pacing around my living room and in the end called my mum, but obviously she couldn't help me, so I woke up my roommate and that was when I had my first, big panic attack. I could feel the waves, I didn't cry, I just spoke about all the things that I thought had caused it at 10x speed and I breathed through it.

The next day I was sensitive and exhausted but I didn't have a panic attack. The day after that, I had another panic attack on the shuttle bus to work, this time I lost all feeling in my legs and I didn't have time to calm down properly due to a big end of semester meeting that morning and just drifted through the rest of the day.

From the 28th to the 31st, everything is blur. I didn't eat much, had another panic attack (this time with nausea and shaking) on the night of the 28th, reached out to someone I knew could help me while also giving my roommate some time off, used herbal sleep aids to help me calm down and rest in between.

On the 30th, I had the biggest anxiety attack ever. In the evening I started hyperventilating and I was terrified, my friend came over and helped me calm down, took me for a walk, and even sat with me while I tried to sleep. But every time I was close to sleeping, I would wake up thinking that my breathing was irregular and that I was going to stop breathing in my sleep.

The next day, I went to the hospital and they put me on medication (buspirone and alprazolam) which I was to take 3 times a day (thanks to the lack of communication, I figured out timings that worked for me). I was upset and terrified, I didn't want to be on medication, I didn't like the side effects I experienced and *I felt so out of control*.

I ended up still going on my trip to Seoul for my birthday in January, I experience a minor panic attack and depression in the third week of taking the medication, but my roommate calmed me down and really looked after me (shout out to her for everything). In the second week of our trip and the forth week taking the medication, I got my appetite back and managed to really enjoy my time in the city, even traveling alone despite my worries. I was finally back on track.

My plan when I got back to China was to have check ups with my doctor, ask for support in order to get off of the medication and help with my health anxiety. But then the coronavirus happened.

I'm still on the medication, its been just over two months, I can't go to my local hospital because its currently shutdown to contain the patients so I get them delivered. (re coronavirus: our city hasn't had a new case in over a week and nearly everyone has been discharged, yay!) I have a mild fear of becoming addicted to the Xanax, my mum is also worried and I want to wean myself off. I'm too scared to do it by myself and my doctor here just tells me to carry on taking it (plus we cant have appointments) so I doubt I'll be off it until I get back home in June. I'm trying to keep telling myself that it's a process and its okay, but it can be hard.

The medication no longer physically effects me badly anymore, but I still deal with health anxiety (mainly breathing) and weird things like sensitive teeth (anyone else get that?). This week has been rough as I've had the most insane heartburn and the return of my stomach issues...its been really demotivating and upsetting.

**I've gotten to the point where I don't know whats anxiety, whats actual sickness, whats just regular symptoms of menses or a certain food I had etc. I just don't know.**

,Anxiety,"Good evening,

We met last summer and kept things friendly until about 5 months ago when we made things exclusive. I am 26yo and she is 22yo. She currently lives approximately a 7 hour drive away as I am finishing my university degree.  We plan to spend one month together after I graduate and there is the possibility to make arrangements for permanent. I am in my final year and will be able to relocate wherever I please so long-distance is a temporary fixture. 

My main issue right now: I have a history of anxiety in relationships for reasons I do not know. Therapy has not been useful for me in the past. She is very understanding of anxiety and supportive in this way, however, there are things in the relationship that cause me anxiety such as:

\- She leaves messages on read or posts on facebook while leaving the message unread. She has expressed that she dislikes when her family members do this to her but I did not use that as an opportunity to make the comparison. I have not expressed my frustration with this as I feel it is nitpicky. 

\- When messaging, she will disappear for several hours. I have never been concerned with cheating, though I never know when exactly she will return. I have expressed this with some resolve but there are still several gaps.

\- We agreed that we would send letters back and forth during my absence until we can be reunited. I sent a letter at the end of December. She asked me for my address 3 times but has not sent the letter to date. I have expressed this but have not seen any results.

I feel like she is getting annoyed with me and my anxiety at this point -- my anxiety is causing me anxiety because I worry so much now that my anxiety is going to drive her away so I don't express that anxiety. I will be done my studies in one month but I honestly don't know how much longer I can go. I love her and want to keep pushing through this. 

Can anybody share any advice or experiences they have had with relationship anxiety?

,Anxiety,"Hi, I am a 43 year old male who's wife is extremely unsupportive when it comes to the idea of taking medication for anxiety. 

I have been diagnosed with OCD and GAD and am currently taking Luvox and also started on Seroquel the past month. In the past I was on Abilify and she lost it when she found that out so I stopped. I went on Seroquel after still feeling constant anxiety about a month ago (behind her back, yes an ultimately bad decision) and figured I would tell her once I knew if it was helpful. 

Cue to a couple of weeks ago when on the flight back from Europe I made a mess over drinking the complimentary wine, blacked out, got in a fight with her and ended up walking out for the night. I have had issues with alcohol in the past and recognize that I should not be drinking at all much less in public. Also this was in front of our kids which I'm ashamed of.

During the time I was gone she dumped all the alcohol in the house and went through my bag and found the medication. The next morning after I had gotten home and been passed out for a while she ripped into me and focused on the meds as the source of everything. I tried to talk to her about it but she refused to hear anything how it was helping (sober) and went as far to say ""I don't know who you are anymore, you're not the same person I used to know."" This hurt more than anything. Also with the anxiety I should suck it up and get over it already.

Fast forward to last night when she had her second therapy session since this all happened she again came home and started fighting immediately. I am in therapy too and then this weekend we have a family session for just the two of us and suggested waiting to talk about it until then but she continued into how I betrayed her by going behind her back and taking the medicine and again to just deal with the anxiety. I asked her why she was so against medication and her answer was ""Why not?"". We also got into it over my perception that she's always pissed and that I'm wrong and the kids are wrong. I tried explaining that it's the constant yelling and threats she has towards the kids that are big reasons we feel like this but she still doesn't feel she did anything wrong. She said the only thing she wants to hear is that I'm quitting the meds but I want to do it for myself and not her but I don't want to do that because they're actually helping.

We went to be separate times without speaking and have only texted today.

Any advice? I feel attacked when we try to talk about it and this weekend even with someone mediating it's going to be a hard thing.

Also, she's in the medical field and I'm the primary caregiver for the kids, who she leaves with when she stomps out on a weekly basis.

I started a really difficult school program about 2 weeks ago. The past week I’ve felt an insane amount of anxiety.

Crying for seemingly no reason with no ability to stop is also a symptom I have had and struggled with before. My emotions tell me that there’s nothing to be worried about but my body is telling me a completely different story. I reduced caffeine last week but even last night I woke up every hour on the hour with the heart pounding and breathing issues/feeling of panic and terror. 

The sleep anxiety actually happens a lot, I’ll have nights where I’m worried I won’t wake up to my alarm and I’ll wake up every hour thinking I overslept in a complete panic. This is a bit different though, because of how physical the feeling is. I wondered if I was even having a heart attack the other night.

,Anxiety,"I have a big problem with people pleasing. It's almost subconscious, I filter myself intensely. I fear making people uncomfortable, even though I used to not care what people think. College has done a number on me. I think of things to say and shut it all down because it's not funny enough or clever, I feel like it may cross some sort of line. I fear that talking about myself will make the other people feel like I don't care about them.

I never voice my own opinions. When someone says something biased I literally shift my thinking to match theirs so that I don't cause a disagreement. And even though I knew my original opinion, I will have convinced myself that the other person is right. My own ways of thinking are changing to accommodate others.

I get serious anxiety in conversations because I fear that I will make the other person uncomfortable. I fear that my body language isn't the language they're looking for. I want to react in the way that they intend for me to.

I am very aware that I am a people pleaser and a doormat and I have tried so hard to just be myself but it is so unbelievably hard to make this big of a change. I immediately feel awkward after saying what I want, even if the other person responds well I overthink and fail to make more conversation afterwards so it just goest silent and gets uncomfortable and then I pray I'd get swallowed by the Earth.

I have tried meditating several times. I have only had a running streak of three days. I give up very easily if I don't see results and sitting in meditation makes me so uncomfortable. It's very hard for me to focus my attention away from my thoughts. Any time I think I have shifted my attention, I realize that I'm thinking about where my attention is and therefore focusing on my thoughts again. I am really hard on myself in meditation, it's almost impossible for me to not be, and I was afraid that I could be making the problem worse.

 I am very anti-pill and cannot afford therapy. I just want to be myself again, unfiltered and weird but confident. I want to make genuine friends who like me and I want to like them. I want to be able to stand my ground and voice my opinions. And dance without feeling like I look weird and sing without thinking about my pitch.

Do you know anything that could help me? I already know the basic ""accept yourself"" things. I need actual actions that I can practice to achieve that acceptance. Someone being like ""just love yourself"" is like ""Just go buy a mansion"", you can't just do it, you have to work for it.

It&amp;#39;s almost subconscious, I filter myself intensely. I fear making people uncomfortable, even though I used to not care what people think. College has done a number on me. I think of things to say and shut it all down because it&amp;#39;s not funny enough or clever, I feel like it may cross some sort of line. I fear that talking about myself will make the other people feel like I don&amp;#39;t care about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never voice my own opinions. When someone says something biased I literally shift my thinking to match theirs so that I don&amp;#39;t cause a disagreement. And even though I knew my original opinion, I will have convinced myself that the other person is right. My own ways of thinking are changing to accommodate others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get serious anxiety in conversations because I fear that I will make the other person uncomfortable. I fear that my body language isn&amp;#39;t the language they&amp;#39;re looking for. I want to react in the way that they intend for me to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very aware that I am a people pleaser and a doormat and I have tried so hard to just be myself but it is so unbelievably hard to make this big of a change. I immediately feel awkward after saying what I want, even if the other person responds well I overthink and fail to make more conversation afterwards so it just goest silent and gets uncomfortable and then I pray I&amp;#39;d get swallowed by the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried meditating several times. I have only had a running streak of three days. I give up very easily if I don&amp;#39;t see results and sitting in meditation makes me so uncomfortable. It&amp;#39;s very hard for me to focus my attention away from my thoughts.

,Anxiety,"Hey all!

Before i'll start,i'll say i'm sorry if they are some part you don't understand or if they are grammatical error,as English is not my native language,i'll try to explain if needed,anyway...

[So 3 month ago i posted this!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/e2phhu/how_to_change_a_disgusting_habit_that_put_me_in/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share,refering it at ""that post"" or ""the post"") (i'm gonna mention this post multiple time) And i've gone through many changes in my life,let me explain a bit: Back when i've started to have this problem,i recently turned 18,and i've begin my last year of school before going to college/university,and i was learning how to drive.

So in November,I was hit with a problem where I got anxiety for nothing (in the beginning,i was thinking it was because of what i mentionned in that post,where in reality it was much complicated,involving my past,my familly,etc...). The month of December was... well very depressing for me (even though I've enjoyed a great Christmas and New Year Eve with family and friends,these were the only moments when I was feeling good during December).

In January,not because of the New Year Resolution,but because after the New Year Eve my anxiety reappeared,i've decided to take multiple actions to fight against this:
-I've decided to go outside (since I was always in my home doing nothing) and walk,1 ""walk"" per week
-I've taken a appointement for a therapy with a psychologist
-I've decided for that specific problem mentionned in that last post (since I thought it was only this),to do something else (so i couldn't think about that),so i've bought a Guitar and begin to learn on how to play!
-Since i was alone in my class,i've decided to try to be more sociable with my classmates (making some friends,talk with them,etc... and to be honest it was hard)
-I've continued to take some medication to reduce this anxiety

On late January and February,i've begin to realize that this anxiety have begin to 
dissapear! I still got some moments where I was not feeling good and even got one time where I was thinking about killing myself (but i've manage to convince myself to not do it),Then,mid-February come and i've noticed that I got a day without anxiety,then two,then three... etc...

And i realize yesterday,that i've passed two weeks without an axiety problem,i am now happier than me during November,i'm not thinking about these problems anymore,i've stopped taking those medications and i'm not getting anxiety anymore.

It took me 3 months,i cried a lot,i've thinked about quitting my high-school or kill myself,but,I got some familly members,some friends,my psychologist who have helped me during this period of my life... I can't describe how i am thankful (and for that friend i mentionned in that previous post on this subreddit... i'm gonna bought him a good present because i think he deserved it so much).

I would end this post,by saying that i am also thankful for this community and this subreddit. Everyday i've checked it,I've seen the stories of different persons who got the same problems (or differents problems) and are willing to fight against it.

&lt;p&gt;So in November,I was hit with a problem where I got anxiety for nothing (in the beginning,i was thinking it was because of what i mentionned in that post,where in reality it was much complicated,involving my past,my familly,etc...). The month of December was... well very depressing for me (even though I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed a great Christmas and New Year Eve with family and friends,these were the only moments when I was feeling good during December).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January,not because of the New Year Resolution,but because after the New Year Eve my anxiety reappeared,i&amp;#39;ve decided to take multiple actions to fight against this:
-I&amp;#39;ve decided to go outside (since I was always in my home doing nothing) and walk,1 &amp;quot;walk&amp;quot; per week
-I&amp;#39;ve taken a appointement for a therapy with a psychologist
-I&amp;#39;ve decided for that specific problem mentionned in that last post (since I thought it was only this),to do something else (so i couldn&amp;#39;t think about that),so i&amp;#39;ve bought a Guitar and begin to learn on how to play!
-Since i was alone in my class,i&amp;#39;ve decided to try to be more sociable with my classmates (making some friends,talk with them,etc... and to be honest it was hard)
-I&amp;#39;ve continued to take some medication to reduce this anxiety&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On late January and February,i&amp;#39;ve begin to realize that this anxiety have begin to 
dissapear! I still got some moments where I was not feeling good and even got one time where I was thinking about killing myself (but i&amp;#39;ve manage to convince myself to not do it),Then,mid-February come and i&amp;#39;ve noticed that I got a day without anxiety,then two,then three... etc...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And i realize yesterday,that i&amp;#39;ve passed two weeks without an axiety problem,i am now happier than me during November,i&amp;#39;m not thinking about these problems anymore,i&amp;#39;ve stopped taking those medications and i&amp;#39;m not getting anxiety anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me 3 months,i cried a lot,i&amp;#39;ve thinked about quitting my high-school or kill myself,but,I got some familly members,some friends,my psychologist who have helped me during this period of my life... I can&amp;#39;t describe how i am thankful (and for that friend i mentionned in that previous post on this subreddit... i&amp;#39;m gonna bought him a good present because i think he deserved it so much).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would end this post,by saying that i am also thankful for this community and this subreddit. Everyday i&amp;#39;ve checked it,I&amp;#39;ve seen the stories of different persons who got the same problems (or differents problems) and are willing to fight against it. You guys are courageous people and not cowards and I hope that you will also fight against it and finally be able to live without anxiety. I&amp;#39;ll still watch those stories,and I would love to help you guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,for reading my long post &lt;del&gt;and probably full of grammatical errors&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I’m a 19 year old former chef, this is where my problems with anxiety formed, it Started last January when I had my first panic attack whilst at work, I don’t really count that as the actual beginning of my problems because it was a while before the next attack.

,Anxiety," 

For the last 1.5 months I have had some issues with my speech. These are in regards to the “th”, “t”, “d” sounds ( not like every word but some words all at random). For example, instead of saying “today” , I would say “tuday”, instead of “do” I would say “du”. I can say them words correctly most of the time.

This thing is my biggest worry now and hasn’t gone away and is causing me massive anxiety. I am not sure if this is anxiety and then me worrying about it causing more anxiety and more issue. I some times feel like my tongue is going crazy and doesn’t know where it needs to be placed to get the right pronunciation.

No one has really noticed this and also no one has noticed me slurring.

I did see my PCP last week about the same and she did not notice anything and sent me away saying its anxiety and nothing to worry.

,Anxiety,"Hopefully this is okay here, and I apologize in advance for the novel I’m going to write. 

Little background: My fiancée and I have been together for 5 years. Things have been amazing, and things have also been NOT so amazing. He’s bi-polar and has manic depression which is a helluva combination sometimes, but over the past year or so he’s actually overcome it some, which is great! 

We’ve gone through a lot of mild trauma in the past 5 years and it’s definitely taken it’s toll on us - we’ve worked through a lot of it and as of now we are actually in a good place financially and in our relationship. BUT for whatever reason I feel like I am still just in a constant panic mode. 

Whenever he has a bad day or gets angry or even mildly upset at something (his job is stupid stressful so it happens quite a bit now), my heart starts to race and I feel like my stomach is spinning like a frickin washing machine. Like today on the way to work, he got pulled over because we have not updated the registration on our car yet (just moved states) and luckily he got away with a warning and a court date to prove we registered the car. We knew this might happen and honestly it could have been a lot worse, but he was already having a bad day and i FEEL like it’s going to ruin his whole day, and that in return throws me into this mood where I can’t focus and I just feel so physically ill.

I want to stress that he is an AMAZING partner, he’s never hurt me so it’s not that I’m afraid of him. I don’t know what it is honestly, I’ve been this way as long as I can remember.

And it’s not even just him, I do this with anyone I care about. I know I shouldn’t let other people’s emotions affect me but it’s so hard to ignore sometimes. I’m constantly panicking about things I haven’t done or things I HAVE done, and this is just the cherry on top. 

I have an appointment with my doctor at the end of this month to get a new therapist, but in this moment I just felt like I needed to write all of this out, and then have a good cry.

I've never had one or had any real struggle with anxiety before outside of crowded places making me a little on edge and certain social interactions made me uncomfortable but all very manageable stuff.

Now all the sudden I've been in a living hell for 2.5 months. But I've been slowly chipping away at certain things. Friday will be 2 weeks cigarette free. I quit cold turkey because more times than not they would give me palpitations or an attack so I dropped them as soon as I connected those dots.

,Anxiety,"I recently got a job offer for digital marketing in a niche market. The moment I heard the offer, my stomach dropped and I felt so much dread. The usual self doubt and projecting came up. But I also have concerns this isn’t the type of marketing job I want (all PPC campaigns). I know I can’t always trust my emotions, but is there ever a time to trust my gut?

My anxiety can be so debilitating that I feel like I can’t trust my emotions at all. Everything is seen through the highs and lows of anxiety. This job checks off a lot of boxes, but is missing elements and I’m not sure if I trust my gut or just go with the job. 

I also have major concerns about my mental health. I left my last job two months ago because of a serious depressive episode triggered by my work environment. As you can imagine, a huge fear of mine is that happening again. 

Pros:
* Good salary (currently struggling financially)
* Good company growth (new and growing department)
* In the marketing field 

Cons:
* Lack of creative opportunities (looking for some graphic design elements)
* Not my endgame in marketing field - would love more content development, organic marketing 
* Niche market not interesting

,Anxiety,"We humans are social creatures, that's why we are always wanting to post something in social media; not because we need to prove we are better, but because we want to be seen. We want people to notice us, we want to break our own loneliness.

The thing is that we did not evolve to have virtual interactions. Humankind spent thousands of years living without internet or social media, but in the previous decades our own understanding of ""social interaction"" has been changed.

Likes, replys and shares are now part of what we know as social interaction, but these sorts of ""comunication tools"" are not really natural, they are a way technology uses to fill the blanks of a not-face-to-face interaction. These tools, as they are not natural - as we were not made to use them in true social relations - leave an empty space in our need to be fulfilled because they can't attend our expectations by complete.

As good as video calls can be, they don't bring us the contact or the natural flow of a in person conversation. Long distance relationships are a nice example. Although people can mantain them and even succed after long times of distance, they are always looking forward to meet each other, because they can feel what's missing. This works the same in other kinds of social interactions.

That's why some people seem very different from what they are in real life and what they are in WhatsApp. This app is just a tool - a representation - of human interaction is and should not replace the real relations.

The huge problem here is the mental health implications these new tools and apps are causing us. There's not much study about it. But books such as ""The Shallows"" show us that our neuroplasticity can be getting lead to change itself in a bad path. If we get used to that sorts of fake virtual interactions, our understading and reaction to true interactions might be compromised and our expectations of true converstations might not be fulfilled, leading us to get more anti-social and be wanting more and more fake interactions in an attempt to fill our need to have real and fulfilling social relations.",t2_4g6xxf5i,False,,0,False,WhatsApp may be causing anxiety/depression in some people.,[],r/Anxiety,False,1,,0,,False,t3_fdbo7m,False,dark,,public,9,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,9,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1583350183.0,text,1,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We humans are social creatures, that&amp;#39;s why we are always wanting to post something in social media; not because we need to prove we are better, but because we want to be seen.

Although people can mantain them and even succed after long times of distance, they are always looking forward to meet each other, because they can feel what&amp;#39;s missing. This works the same in other kinds of social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why some people seem very different from what they are in real life and what they are in WhatsApp. This app is just a tool - a representation - of human interaction is and should not replace the real relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The huge problem here is the mental health implications these new tools and apps are causing us. There&amp;#39;s not much study about it. But books such as &amp;quot;The Shallows&amp;quot; show us that our neuroplasticity can be getting lead to change itself in a bad path. If we get used to that sorts of fake virtual interactions, our understading and reaction to true interactions might be compromised and our expectations of true converstations might not be fulfilled, leading us to get more anti-social and be wanting more and more fake interactions in an attempt to fill our need to have real and fulfilling social relations.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"TLDR: withdrawals from valium makes it too hard to kick. Taking gabapentin to help, but had withdrawals from trying to stop that as well. Now prescribed Effexor to see if it will help.

Hi guys, I have been taking benzos for 3 years now. I get highly addicted to them, so I want to stop. I was told by my previous psychiatrists that benzos should only be as needed. I went from Xanax .25mg every 2 to 3 hours to Ativan 4x a day to Valium. I was on Valium for about a year, started at 5mg 3x a day to now 2.5mg 1x a day as needed. I had gabapentin 100mg 2x a day to substitute the Valium. So now I am trying to wean off the last bit of valium, I got down to just a nibble of Valium but started having bad withdrawals. I was 10 days off Valium but had horrible panic attacks, muscle spasms, nausea, upset stomach, insomnia... so now I am back on it with the gabapentin.  before i was off the valium I tried to stop gabapentin because I had horrible mood swings, but I also had bad anxiety and withdrawl symptoms. My current psyche said gabapentin doesnt cause withdrawals because it is non habit forming, yet I still had them. Online and forums show that some people are sensitive to it, like myself...
In my past between the xanax and ativan I had almost every SSRI to try and help me feel better. All my psyches told me benzos suck and are highly addictive, whereas SSRI'S and SNRI'S aren't as bad. Research shows me it effects everyone differently,  so who knows. I talked with my psyche today to see if the Effexor would help, since 2 other psyches said it would and google said it helps with panic and anxiety. I have hope, still feel like crap, and want to be off benzos and gabapentin because of my job and kids.

As  I've grown older, I have begun to accept it for what it is. I have better developed some techniques to avoid passing out

,Anxiety,"I just started my last year at school before I graduate and I just had a really bad breakdown.

Yesterday it was my first day. I came back early, and we really didn't do much in class, just got to know our schedule, had an introduction to the teachers, lunch and that's it.

I though I was doing well. The last year I had severe anxiety, started to get therapy every two weeks and took pills as I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. 

I went through some really really bad months were I couldn't leave my house. I had stomachache regularly, felt dizziness, didn't wanna eat, had really bad cramps, headache, chest pressure that even make it difficult to breath for me, tremors all over my body, no motivation to do things like I didn't even want to leave my bed and really felt like I couldn't at some point, and had a constant uneasy feeling that didn't leave me alone. Even to this day.

This past month I actually was doing better, and I was honestly preparing myself to get through with school as it is my last year but I guess my body or mind or I don't fucking know what didn't want that for me. 

I didn't go today. Yesterday I cried like three hours straight. I talked with my mom and she told me that I just have to quit school because it didn't look like I was gonna be able to be okay while I went. She just wanted me to be fine and at peace, and that she was tired of dealing with it WITH me. She has been nothing but supportive of me and actually she got sick too. Because of me. I just want her happy and healthy.

Been waiting months to get something like this. 
It's a cleaning position for a retail chain. 
It's giving me anxiety however. 
I can't even explain it. I want to quit and never planned on staying long so it's not a fear from losing my job or fear of the boss ect. 
As in, I hoped this job would get me back to work, while still applying for better jobs. 

I'm really, really struggling though in a way that I've not had before, atleast not to this degree for such a prolonged period.
It's literally just ""OMG I have work tomorrow"" or ""oh fuck I have work tonight"". Just the thought of having to go in, makes me feel really scared. 

As soon as I'm on my way to work or when I'm at work, those feelings go away. 

It's literally just outside of work, knowing work is coming makes me very shaky and nervous. 
It's completely irrational and I feel pathetic for being so out of control. 
The only thing that helps is beer. 
I hate being drunk, so I don't drink to get drunk, just to get buzzed. 
I know alcohol afterwards makes you feel anxious, so it's just going to embolden my issue. But it's the only thing that helps me. 
I feel like shit. I need to work, everybody should if they can right? This is just 16-20 hours a week.
I'm just tired of being scared though, I just want to quit and stop relying on alcohol to chill out.

,Anxiety,"As long as I can remember, I've always found comfort in moving my fingers through fabric. It was so bad that I used to carry a blanket I had with me around until I turned 11. I find it all very relieving at times.

I'm a college student now and while I don't do anything of the sort in public, when I'm back at my dorm I do it constantly. It somewhat clears my mind. I think and worry about every single little detail, and all of a sudden it's just like all of that, everything I've been stressing about, is gone. I still feel the responsibility to work on things, but I don't feel the crippling stress that goes with it.

The problem is when I do this, lots of time can pass. I can push assignments to the side that I need to work on and get done. I've tried leaving my dorm to find somewhere else to study, but then the problem is I feel incredibly stressed out while I'm working. It's almost like subconsciously I believe someone is watching every little thing I do when I know that they aren't, and yet it still worries me.

I have a hard time leaving my dorm room to use the community bathroom sometimes because I worry that my floor mates will be pissed because I'm in there. Concurrently, I believe that I make them feel weird because I have a hard time socializing normally.

I try my best to be as positive as possible. I'd like to believe that I'm nice to people... But I just think it makes them feel uncomfortable talking to me so I sit by myself when I go eat which worsens the stereotype that I am someone that can't talk to other people.

If I'm being honest here, my mind is a mess. When I focus on things, I can be intelligible but it's just so hard with everything going on around me.

When I get on the bus to get to campus I feel awkward if I look anywhere other than out the window. I feel that someone might be concerned that I'm looking at them for some reason when I'm really not. When I'm not sitting next to the window, I'll pull my phone out and then worry that someone is watching what I am doing.

I work with this one gaming organization on campus and I really want to go to more of our events, but I worry that when I go no one will want to talk to me so I'll just be that weird dude trying to fit in with everyone when it is obvious that I don't.

I like being alone, but it can feel so lonely at times. It's like a paradox. I don't want to be alone, but at the same time I struggle to communicate so much that I don't even feel human. I have sympathy for others, I feel happy at times, I cry when I see or hear something sad... but I never know what to talk about. So a lot of the time I just ask generic questions at the surface level because I don't believe anyone would understand if I just started talking to them about the programs I write or the games that I play

When I see how socially advanced others are, and how far that's gotten them I just can't help but feel even worse about myself

I get depressed a lot. There will be days where I briefly entertain the idea of suicide but then consider all the things I have to live for and all the people I would deeply hurt in the process

I think so much anymore that I don't know what to believe and know that if I spent that energy thinking about all the right things rather than all the wrong things that I'd be able to accomplish something great, but I just don't know how

I tried a therapist, and they just didn't understand anything I was going through. All of their questions were surface level. I think I even made my therapist feel weird with the things I would say about all the ways that I feel hurt. It gets harder to manage everything. I have good days and I have really bad days. They sort of rotate, and sometimes that desperation can be seen by other people though I try to hide it as much as possible and remain positive however much I feel hurt

That's about it. I am sorry for the essay. I just really needed to get this out there. I know I went on a tangent. I'm just not sure what to do at this point

I hope you all have a great Wednesday :)",t2_5uhk7iij,False,,0,False,I don't know,[],r/Anxiety,False,1,,0,,False,t3_fdg9j8,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1583371161.0,text,1,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as I can remember, I&amp;#39;ve always found comfort in moving my fingers through fabric. It was so bad that I used to carry a blanket I had with me around until I turned 11. I find it all very relieving at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a college student now and while I don&amp;#39;t do anything of the sort in public, when I&amp;#39;m back at my dorm I do it constantly. It somewhat clears my mind. I think and worry about every single little detail, and all of a sudden it&amp;#39;s just like all of that, everything I&amp;#39;ve been stressing about, is gone. I still feel the responsibility to work on things, but I don&amp;#39;t feel the crippling stress that goes with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is when I do this, lots of time can pass. I can push assignments to the side that I need to work on and get done. I&amp;#39;ve tried leaving my dorm to find somewhere else to study, but then the problem is I feel incredibly stressed out while I&amp;#39;m working. It&amp;#39;s almost like subconsciously I believe someone is watching every little thing I do when I know that they aren&amp;#39;t, and yet it still worries me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a hard time leaving my dorm room to use the community bathroom sometimes because I worry that my floor mates will be pissed because I&amp;#39;m in there. Concurrently, I believe that I make them feel weird because I have a hard time socializing normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try my best to be as positive as possible. I&amp;#39;d like to believe that I&amp;#39;m nice to people... But I just think it makes them feel uncomfortable talking to me so I sit by myself when I go eat which worsens the stereotype that I am someone that can&amp;#39;t talk to other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m being honest here, my mind is a mess. When I focus on things, I can be intelligible but it&amp;#39;s just so hard with everything going on around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get on the bus to get to campus I feel awkward if I look anywhere other than out the window. I feel that someone might be concerned that I&amp;#39;m looking at them for some reason when I&amp;#39;m really not. When I&amp;#39;m not sitting next to the window, I&amp;#39;ll pull my phone out and then worry that someone is watching what I am doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work with this one gaming organization on campus and I really want to go to more of our events, but I worry that when I go no one will want to talk to me so I&amp;#39;ll just be that weird dude trying to fit in with everyone when it is obvious that I don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like being alone, but it can feel so lonely at times. It&amp;#39;s like a paradox. I don&amp;#39;t want to be alone, but at the same time I struggle to communicate so much that I don&amp;#39;t even feel human. I have sympathy for others, I feel happy at times, I cry when I see or hear something sad... but I never know what to talk about. So a lot of the time I just ask generic questions at the surface level because I don&amp;#39;t believe anyone would understand if I just started talking to them about the programs I write or the games that I play&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"
Hi all, I just needed a safe place to vent and this sub is it for me really. I’m not sure I can cope with this anymore, every symptom I get i’m assuming the worst: right now it’s either ovarian cancer, some ‘hard to detect’ cancer, something auto immune, UTI or diabetes... all sorts. 

My core fear really is that I do have something wrong, something hard to diagnose and with a generally grim prognosis but I also have health anxiety, so being honest and upfront about my specific worries to my GP will now further make a diagnosis of anything non anxiety related harder.

I felt unwell in September and haven’t felt better since with an army of different symptoms. I was fine before, anxiety free. Got blurry vision and a tight chest and started thinking about lung cancer. Have reoccurring throat infections so think that must be a sign to seriously ill health. 

I have had, symptom wise, a huge amount (* means symptoms I think can not possibly be just anxiety!)
- Tight chest
- Indigestion
- Difficulty swallowing
- Rib pain (when pressed) *
- Abdomen pain
- Head pain
- Pelvic pain, both sides
- Thigh pain
- Blurry vision
- Dry/watery eyes 
- Numbness and tingliness in random body parts
- Rashes/hives *
- Wrinkly skin on palms of hand, as if i’ve been in water ****
- Sensitive skin, reacts easily***
- More visible veins *
- No appetite 
- Fatigue *

I have had multiple ultrasounds, a brain CT scan, an abdomen/pelvic CT scan, tons of blood tests including a negative ANA and ENA auto immune panel. Now I want an all body MRI and more up to date blood tests 😞 I just want to feel normal again

All of the illnesses I have thought I could have (5 months worth):

cancers:
lung, mouth/tonsil/tongue, oesophagus, liver, bile duct, stomach, colon, brain, breast, ovary, cervix, leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, bone

neurological/auto immune/other:
multiple sclerosis
lyme disease
motor neurone disease 
mast cell disease
ehlas danos vascular type
scleroderma
connective tissue disorder
sibo+candida overgrowth

The list goes on and is embarrassing but I can’t help but think there is definitely something wrong ugh. I am on anti depressants and they seem to do not much at all, I have tried numerous. This just further makes me think it is an actual illness causing this. I also wonder about what symptoms are caused by my illness and what are from the medication? Example is I am now getting night sweats, but that can be a side effect of duloxetine so do I run to the doctors or just suck it up and potentially ignore a symptom that is a sign of a serious disease or infection?

I start CBT therapy on the 9th but honestly at this point doubt anyone can save me from this hell of a brain/body. I am reluctant to even try therapy incase it further distracts me from the potential disease I have and will end up being one of those misdiagnosed cases that just got thrown ‘anxiety’ at them because their condition was rare or unusual. :[ I feel so lonely and frightened all of the time. No one understands at all and I feel like my case is beyond severe and no one can help me

Sorry for the long post ☹️ I just don’t feel convinced that anxiety could cause all of these physical sensations, rashes and body changes :[",t2_3ql1gbh9,False,,0,False,"Health anxiety rant, fear of misdiagnosis of anxiety when it could be a rare disease... ☹️",[],r/Anxiety,False,1,venting,0,,False,t3_fdi74f,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Venting,False,1,,False,self,1583350378.0,,[],{},,True,,1583378672.0,text,1,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I just needed a safe place to vent and this sub is it for me really. I’m not sure I can cope with this anymore, every symptom I get i’m assuming the worst: right now it’s either ovarian cancer, some ‘hard to detect’ cancer, something auto immune, UTI or diabetes... all sorts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My core fear really is that I do have something wrong, something hard to diagnose and with a generally grim prognosis but I also have health anxiety, so being honest and upfront about my specific worries to my GP will now further make a diagnosis of anything non anxiety related harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt unwell in September and haven’t felt better since with an army of different symptoms. I was fine before, anxiety free. Got blurry vision and a tight chest and started thinking about lung cancer. Have reoccurring throat infections so think that must be a sign to seriously ill health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had, symptom wise, a huge amount (* means symptoms I think can not possibly be just anxiety!)
- Tight chest
- Indigestion
- Difficulty swallowing
- Rib pain (when pressed) *
- Abdomen pain
- Head pain
- Pelvic pain, both sides
- Thigh pain
- Blurry vision
- Dry/watery eyes 
- Numbness and tingliness in random body parts
- Rashes/hives *
- Wrinkly skin on palms of hand, as if i’ve been in water ****
- Sensitive skin, reacts easily***
- More visible veins *
- No appetite 
- Fatigue *&lt;/p&gt;

This hasn't really happened to me with anxiety before, at least not for a whole month. I'm so stressed, I cant even realize WHAT I'm even thinking about. It's there, but it's all jumbled. My thoughts in my head and the feelings in my heart feel very mixed up and misunderstood. I made the decision to go January and I have been avoiding looking up any other careers or letting myself sway from that decision, but I still can't breathe.. I cant stand the thought of dealing with this breathing issue until, and maybe during, school next january. I can't help but think maybe this is intuition telling me to stay at home longer and explore the crafty things I have never had time for since next year I will actually get a break when my youngest goes to preschool 6hr a week. While obsessing over careers, I stubbed my pinky toe and sprained it (louise hays says it's a sign for obsessing over minor details of the future), then had a dream that my head was getting crushed in an elevator door when I tried to follow my pregnant friend out..
I'm just so overwhelmed and dont trust my head in making the right decision I guess. 
Maybe it's just anxiety trying to hold me back from any change since I've stayed at home for 5yrs.

,Anxiety,"Hi all,

Sorry for posting again, I know I've asked lots of questions about anxiety and zoloft.

I have a lot of chest discomfort and palpatations. It'll be when I get up, or move around, even when I'm just sitting. It's random and stressful and I hate it. I've had EKG, echo, stress test, blood test, etc. I even had a holter monitor 10 years ago when my anxiety was really severe at the end of university. And everything came back okay. But I can't stop thinking I have a heart problem.

So I'm wondering, for anyone that took zoloft/sertraline, did you find it helped you with heart racing, heart paplatations, chest pain and that obsessive worrying about your heart?

But I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking I have a heart problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m wondering, for anyone that took zoloft/sertraline, did you find it helped you with heart racing, heart paplatations, chest pain and that obsessive worrying about your heart? Trying to convince myself to go up to 75mg like my doctor suggested instead of running to another walk-in to request more heart tests.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m a young adult and I’m living with my SO since 2 years back, I’ve been working for several companies over the past 5 years which means I started working during my teens when I still went to school. However mainly why I stop work and quit my job is because it feels like imma bout to explode of anxiety, stress, never feeling happy, having this big lump in my stomach, feeling tired etc. And it usually appears after 6 months- 1 year. I’ve never worked at the same place more than a year except for one job were it took me 2 years to reach the same point of discomfort. 

Now, at my “current” job (it’s super messy cus I’m unemployed but I still work there 50% cus I need money and I haven’t find a new job even to I’ve done my best the past month) my boss treats me like shit, I’m basically the manager there but not officially, he constantly gets mad at me for stuff I don’t do, he watch me throttle security cameras and he has a microphone so he can listen to everything I say and do and he watch us as a f*cking tv show and it makes me constantly nervous even tho I might not do anything wrong, also it ILLEGAL to watch activity and record with audio but it’s impossible to prove cus he could just denying wherever he is doing. And he have don’t shit like lock the employees toilet so we almost peed ourself cus we could use the bathroom and shit like that. 

But lately I’ve been feeling worse about my anxiety, I feel stressed all the time, I never feel like I’ve slept enough and always feel tired, I get headaches all the time, I don’t have energy to do anything, and I believe I’ve developed diabetes through stress which stress me out even more. It never feels like I have time to jut sit down and breathe out, cus if I do it feels like I’m just wasting time. It also affected my relationship with my so cus I’m constantly uncomfortable angry and I’ve never been an aggressive person in my life, I’ve always been calm and it takes a lot to make me really angry but now it could be the smallest thing and I wanna punch someone in the face or spit in their face, and I haven’t had the mood for sex for about over 3 months. 

So lately I’ve been thinking if I got fatigue syndrome (I don’t know if it’s the right term cus English isn’t my first language) but every single time I think about reaching out to a hospital about it it feels like “wtf no why? It’s not that bad you’re just having a  bad day and it will go away” or “I’m just wasting their time on something that it’s even that bad, you’re pretty fine otherwise”

It just feels like I don’t need to seek help or get medical help cus it’s not that bad but sometimes it feels like imma bout to explode of stress and anger and anxiety and I don’t know what to do. 

I guess I just need someone else perspective or experience to understand that it’s worth it and it will get better. I need a push in the back that just makes me take that step out of my comfort zone and get the help I maybe need.

,Anxiety,"Hey everyone, first time posting here and on my phone. Little back story, I (26/F) have been on medication to help my anxiety since June of last year. It really helped me a lot. Last year was the worst year to date. My boyfriend lost his dad and grandpa within 3 weeks of each other, and we found both of them. His dad had already been dead for 3 days so we saw him during decomp and I don’t think we will ever get over that. We were put in charge of his dads estate because there was no will, which caused major stress having to deal with probate court. I found out I had cervical cancer and had to have part of my cervix removed. My nephew got into a life altering car crash and almost died in October, 2 people in the car died but he survived and is still learning to walk again. It was just a really bad year.

Fast forward to this week. My nephew is starting to walk in his walker and got off probation which is amazing. My boyfriend got a new job that is exactly what he has been looking for to progress in his career. Things are good right now, really good, but now my anxiety is even higher. It’s like I am waiting for something bad to happen, because it’s all I’ve known for the last year. I’ve had multiple anxiety episodes the last 3 days, and I had a panic attack yesterday. The feeling of impending doom won’t go away. I don’t know what to do. 

Has anyone felt this way, and what did you do to help yourself out? I want to believe in the good things and stay in the moment but this anxiety is physically holding me back.

I hate even the idea of making someone angry or irritated. I keep telling myself how much I absolutely hate any sort of conflict, but I think that’s became me having increased anxiety when my friends even rant to me about something in their lives and increased anxiety in general I think. 

It’s so godamn frustrating. And my girl is neurotypical so it’s even worse that I struggle so badly to explain, let alone fully understand, why I do these irrational things.

I recently got into a 10 month long program taking me thousands of miles away from home and I move every few months so I can’t really see a therapist :/ I don’t really have friends I feel really comfortable talking to about these mental health type things. At least I’m not in a major depression like I was a year ago. That’s good :) ok, nite&lt;/p&gt;

Before I go any further this is not advice to do it yourself without telling a doctor or professional. Every one reacts differently and the right support is so important. Tell your doctor, and ask them for their recommendation. I'm only putting this here because every doctor I spoke to had a different method and this worked amazingly considering I had been on the medication for so long (6 years at varying doses nothing below 20mg)    

One doctor 3 years ago suggested I halve the dose immediately and I had insomnia and other odd withdrawals so I do not recommend that! I ended up going back to my regular dose. 


I tapered my dose of citalopram from 20mg daily to 10mg over the course of about 3-5months (i know it was no less than 3 months anyway)I started by taking the full dose for 6 days and then one day at 10. After a couple of weeks it was 5 days on 20 and two on 10, spaced out during the week so the low doses were not together. I carried on like this with a few weeks at each until I was finally only taking 10mg daily.

This does not apply if you are taking higher doses of an SSRI as you should not be dramatically cutting any long term medication out of your system without professional guidance, I had very dramatic side effects when I missed doses before tapering. I had been on the medication for several years so the taper had to be extremely slow, but some people can come off with no side effects at all if you've been on a low dose or not been on the medication for long. It varies wildly.

I'm just really happy to say this method really helped me with no dramatic side effects. I'm a lot more sleepy than I used to be and have to put work into a healthy lifestyle to maintain my recovery... but I've gone from daily panic attacks to not remembering when my last one was, maybe 6-7months ago ?

Yes I do believe I have GAD but I don’t think that’s all I have. GAD is usually something where you don’t know where your fears are coming from but for me, for most of my biggest fears I could think of certain experiences that started them. For example I had this fear of public washrooms because I watched a video when I was a 5 of some people playing Bloody Mary. But right before I went on medication I had some brand new symptoms some stuff I never felt before.

I literally felt like I was going to die and it was easily the worst point in my life. I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t eat, I was just so weak and constantly crying. I started going on medication and after about 3 months the thoughts stopped completely. It took about 3 weeks for the panic attacks to stop (at the end they weren’t as constant) to me this doesn’t seem to fit GAD.

,Anxiety,"I really don't get how people feel less anxiety or more relaxed from SSRIs I can't wrap my head around it. You know that when you take Xanax, your anxiety symptoms will improve. You know that when you take amphetamine's you'll have energy and be focused. When you take MDMA, you usually feel extremely happy and euphoric. Opiates are almost guaranteed to help pain. I understand there's exceptions to all these but for the vast majority of people this is true. But when it comes to SSRIs, there seems to be so many people (including myself) that don't benefit from them or aren't really sure if they are helping and will end up on multiple trials of SSRIs. I myself have tried three because I have severe debilitating health anxiety, depression and all have been a complete waste of time and energy with onset anxiety and withdrawals that worsened my life. I gave them fair trials (6 months) and it just pisses me off. It seems like the only things that fucking work at all are things you can't take daily like Benzos, phenibut, etc. SSRI's on the other hand you do take daily but in my subjective experience just wasted so much precious time and energy and caused so many additional problems. I will randomly see someone post something saying an SSRI absolutely saved their life and cured all their problems and it frustrates me that I don't respond well to them. I have searched painstakingly hard for safe alternatives to Benzos or other anxiety solutions/ medications and have been on mood stabilizers and other things that just had way too severe side effects for me.

You know that feeling of summer break? It’s always felt to me like my life was paused. Between those months of school, it felt like my progression was paused and I was just *existing* for the summer. It made life feel slightly meaningless and strange. 

I’m not out of high school but am going through the same thing. Do you think it’s because I’m not working out here?

I’ve read all about dissociation and DPDR and it resonates but also definitely scares me because I feel like this will never go away. I’ve been able to get my mind off of things but this weird new perspective of the earth doesn’t go anywhere.

,Anxiety,"I've always been kind of indifferent to birthdays. Don't get me wrong, I love going all out for other people, I absolutely loathe my own. Why? Because it's literally everything I hate wrapped into one.
For starters, I have struggled with social anxiety since I was a kid. I don't want a disorder to affect my life. So the best way to do that is to avoid anything that triggers it if possible. This includes parties, large gatherings, being the center of attention, people ""ooing"" and ""ahhing"" over me, etc. This is pretty much all a birthday is.
If someone casually sends a HBD text or just says it once when they see me, that's cool and much appreciated. I just hate when people try to make a huge deal when I ask them not to. For example, constantly asking what I wanna do or saying HBD everytime you see me. Ofcourse you have the occasional ""Oh let's _____ *insert something that person wants to do* because it's MY birthday.

,Anxiety,"Hi,

I'm doing a business project for one of my university courses. For this project I need to create a product/ service that people as the public would be interested in. For my service I am thinking about doing a cafe that is better suited for those suffering from mental illness or an item or product that can create a safer environment in places where socializing may occur.

I would be very grateful if people would be wiling to comment things that they don't like about cafes, how people cope while being in social situations, or even your opinions on this idea.

,Anxiety,"I am aware of rule 5, but I am absolutely desperate, please do not remove my post

&amp;#x200B;

About 5 months ago I had a near hit experience with a car coming down the street when it shouldn't have (it did not stop for a bus in the lane beside it). It was about, roughly a foot away from hitting me, very close call. I was a bit shocked, but I brushed it off and went along with my day, I didn't think about it at all.   


The next morning, I had a panic attack, the first ever in my life- it was horrible, I didn't even know it was a panic attack at first, my insides felt all wrong- heat flushes, extreme fear, whole show, lasted about an hour before I could calm down. After that day I would sometimes have smaller panic attacks though nothing major, and I luckily as of now have not had any anxiety related symptoms in a few months.  


However, my breathing has been changed. I cannot fully breathe in (only sometimes), if I were to fully breathe in it would feel like I hit a wall, I just am physically incapable of taking a full, deep breath. The same for breathing out, I cannot breathe out all the way, my breath will leave my lungs and bottom out very fast. My breathing change is not harmful, but it is very uncomfortable, sometimes I have to struggle to get my breathing back in sync or satisfy my lungs urge to get a satisfying breath in. This started right after that panic attack 5 months ago. I also feel a little bit of pressure in my lungs consistently.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a General Doctor, who recommended me to a pulmonologist (lung doctor).  I took a breathing test, and because of my inability to breathe normally, I failed, and he prescribed me with Asthma, which is BS because I do NOT have Asthma and never have experienced Asthma. Regardless, I used the inhaler prescribed, and felt absolutely no difference. I went to a therapist, we meditated a bit, talked about it, but I stopped going because the therapist was unable to actually do anything about my issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't believe I took something so simple, breathing, for granted. I wish I could breathe normally, I miss it so much.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 5 months ago I had a near hit experience with a car coming down the street when it shouldn&amp;#39;t have (it did not stop for a bus in the lane beside it). It was about, roughly a foot away from hitting me, very close call. I was a bit shocked, but I brushed it off and went along with my day, I didn&amp;#39;t think about it at all.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I had a panic attack, the first ever in my life- it was horrible, I didn&amp;#39;t even know it was a panic attack at first, my insides felt all wrong- heat flushes, extreme fear, whole show, lasted about an hour before I could calm down. After that day I would sometimes have smaller panic attacks though nothing major, and I luckily as of now have not had any anxiety related symptoms in a few months.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my breathing has been changed. I cannot fully breathe in (only sometimes), if I were to fully breathe in it would feel like I hit a wall, I just am physically incapable of taking a full, deep breath. The same for breathing out, I cannot breathe out all the way, my breath will leave my lungs and bottom out very fast. My breathing change is not harmful, but it is very uncomfortable, sometimes I have to struggle to get my breathing back in sync or satisfy my lungs urge to get a satisfying breath in. This started right after that panic attack 5 months ago. I also feel a little bit of pressure in my lungs consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a General Doctor, who recommended me to a pulmonologist (lung doctor).  I took a breathing test, and because of my inability to breathe normally, I failed, and he prescribed me with Asthma, which is BS because I do NOT have Asthma and never have experienced Asthma. Regardless, I used the inhaler prescribed, and felt absolutely no difference. I went to a therapist, we meditated a bit, talked about it, but I stopped going because the therapist was unable to actually do anything about my issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. I can&amp;#39;t believe I took something so simple, breathing, for granted. I wish I could breathe normally, I miss it so much. I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with this for 5 months, and nothing has ever changed, no progress. Lung doctor could not help, neither could therapist, I don&amp;#39;t know what to do, I feel alone and trapped.&lt;/p&gt;

But when we got there, the SO said to us after we sat at the table, ""Wow great conversation guys"" and it made me kind of mad.

So many times with anxiety, it takes a lot of effort on my part to hang out in social situations. Even with a small group of friends on some level. And the SO continued to act uncomfortable at me and my friends' attempts to engage with them.

It's like they wanted us to ""entertain"" them. And when they decided we were a little uncomfortable or awkward, they projected it as our issue. And it really put things in perspective for me and my friend. We both have terrible anxiety.

But when we thought about it, the SO was super anxious too just in a alternative way. They have a lot of anxiety to be funny and have conversation ALL THE TIME. And when, EVENTUALLY (because everyone is eventually), an awkward moment arises or a joke doesn't hit right, they physically try to disassociate themselves from the conversation.

It makes me heated because at the end of the day, I value my conversations a lot. And I can accept my awkward nature because that is just who I am.

,Anxiety,"Hi all,

I'm a long time sufferer of what I believe to be extreme social anxiety. It really inhibits my ability to effectively communicate with people I don't know very well, things like stuttering, mumbling, losing focus of a conversation, lack of eye contact, afraid to speak up, not knowing what to say, etc. I've recently experienced some progress just by being more conscious in interactions and it has me thinking a lot of my social anxiety might just be due to my ignorance of developing the skill and not being conscious of my mistakes.

I'm in the pursuit of some No-BS books on effective tips I can start using or things I shouldn't be doing in social interactions that I'm currently unaware of. I've seen counselors and I've researched extensively into what anxiety is and how it effects the brain, so I'm not looking for philosophy or anatomy type books, just raw techniques I can use to better my communication and avoid the pitfalls.

&lt;p&gt;May you give up your allegiances to self-doubt, meekness, and hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May you be willing to be unlikeable, and in the process be utterly loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May you be impervious to the wrongful projections of others, and may you deliver your disagreements with precision and grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May you see, with the consummate clarity of nature moving through you, that your voice is not only necessary, but desperately needed to sing us out of this muddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May you feel shored up, supported, entwined, and reassured as you offer yourself and your gifts to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May you know for certain that even as you stand by yourself, you are not alone.”&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I think I just had my first panic attack today

Okay so this might be very long so I’ll just give a brief list of my symptoms and then maybe the story that triggered it later on for those interested. 

Basically I was crying a lot, I felt like I couldn’t breathe, I had my hands on my chest and around my neck cause I felt like there was something restricting my breathing, and my chest kept involuntarily kind of taking short sharp breathes and every time I tried to say words they would get cut out halfway.


So all of this was triggered by a teacher (bear in mind I’m an 18 year old straight A student, not some 12 year old troublemaker)  who admitted afterwards to me that she felt like she was having a breakdown and that she has a lot of things in her personal life at the moment like her child has the flu etc. But basically I asked the teacher a question in class, something I already had some tension towards doing and she completely flipped on me. Called me out in front of the whole class, made me cry, then when that wasn’t enough she took me outside the door and proceeded to shout at me for a solid ten minutes. After this point I could not breathe she was still in my personal space giving out to me for crying basically diminishing my problems and she had to go back into the class to get a friend to help me as I genuinely felt the walls were closing in on me. This whole situation was about an hour in total including the teacher then bursting into tears and trying to act extremely nice clearly realising what she had just done was crazy.

It’s been like 12 hours and my throat still has a lump in it and I feel extremely on edge etc, and I just don’t know what to do. I have an appointment with my parents in the school tomorrow but I’m very anxious

,Anxiety,"A year ago tonight, I had one of the most horrible panic attacks I had had so far in my life - and it was in public, at a party.  I was already having regular attacks and developing agoraphobia, but I had already promised to go to the party, and I was more anxious about backing out that the party itself.  A couple of my friends were there.  I now look back and can see that they might not really be my friends.  

That night, as I somewhat expected, I had a panic attack.  A huge one.  And I looked to my best friends for help, as I feel that most people would.  Is that unreasonable?  To ask your best friend for help during an attack?  I couldn’t calm them on my own, I still can’t, literally no coping mechanisms work for me.  I asked for a hug.  I got a hug, after some pleading, but as I cried into my best friends’ shoulders, they wouldn’t stop whispering about me and how I was annoying them and how they could get away.  I don’t know if they know I heard but I think they wanted me to.  This obviously didn’t make things better for me and many people started to notice me and, though they meant well, the attention and questions were the opposite of what I wanted.  

I eventually was able to get home, long story short.  I went to school the Monday after that party, still fragile and ashamed and shaken up.  My best friends practically ignored me the whole day.  I don’t know what I did wrong.  Please, can someone tell me what I did wrong?  They always turned to me when they were stressed out, I thought I could do similarly?  They said maybe a few sentences to me the whole day. I apologized over and over again for making such a scene.

That night, they both sent emails to me, attacking my whole character and telling me that “I hadn’t been fair to them” that night.  I assume this means that me turning to them for support wasn’t fair?  I felt so bad for spoiling some of their fun, but I thought that friends were supposed to support each other like that...

I was launched into agoraphobia and my already present depression was cranked up to full blast.  I became suicidal and eventually ended up in a psych ward, which brought on whole new traumas (fuck that hellhole, from the bottom of my heart).  A month later, when I went back to school for the like two days I managed to force my way through, I had already been replaced.  Completely replaced.  Like, totally, have different friends and strengthen those friendships and shit, and I feel so jealous and possessive for saying this, but a month?  After a month, you’re going to call this girl your best friend, drop me pretty much entirely, and ignore me/avoid me as much as possible?  I don’t know, am I in the wrong?  I just feel so replaceable and worthless.

It’s been a year, and NOTHING HAS CHANGED.  I am worse off, actually.  I’m more depressed, I still have suicidal thoughts creeping in often, I can force myself to leave the house maybe once a week, twice if I’m really pushing it, I’m still having daily, untriggered panic attacks plus at least weekly triggered ones, and nothing helps, neither the attacks nor the depression.  I’ve been on three or four different meds, nothing.  I’ve gone to several different therapists, no one has clicked with me and I get too anxious to even go, so I’m not even actively in therapy anymore.  No coping techniques I’ve found/been told to try have helped.  The only things that do help during a panic attack are DPT and some sensory grounding, neither of which work for me to apply to myself.

One main reasons I can’t get comfortable with one is probably because the first therapist I saw basically told me I was being over dramatic and I was probably just angry because I had a fight with my friends and I’m just an angsty, perfectionist teenager who needs to get over herself - without letting me talk at all, whatsoever.  It’s hard to come back from that and trust someone.  I feel so weak but it really hurt.  It still hurts.

She has visited a psychologist before but all she talked about was some circle that she keeps falling into and she didn't help a lot. I know it isn't okay to force anybody to visit a psychiatrist but I have went to one before and he helped me a lot so it's really hard when she always says sth like this ""what would I say to him, that im stressed or have low self esteem?"" when I propose the idea as if she thinks her problems are not worthy. Since we live together it has taken a great toll on me also and despite doing everything I can. I simply get overloaded sometimes and confront her and since nothing changes I ignore the problems until I flip again.

,Anxiety,"In October of last year, my father was in the hospital for a week, and almost died. He is okay now and actually in a better state of health than before. But ever since then, I’ve had so much anxiety and I can’t take it. I’ve always had anxiety, but that’s when I think I broke. I got out of school and my aunt picks me up (I usually ride the bus) and tells me my father is in the hospital. I thought she was just going to take me somewhere or something. This sudden, terrible and horrifying news has shaken me. The fact that something so terrible can hit you when you least expect and when things seem fine, makes me feel bleak. Now every phone call, every text, every minor inconvenience, every small mistake I make, every fear consumes me and it feels like the world could fall apart. 

I look at others life and my heart starts to race. Everyone else is smart and has good looks and love. I feel like I have none of that. My depression tells me no one loves me and it makes my anxiety soar because it feels like the people I care about and love don’t care or love me, except for my family, but I don’t have a perfect relationship with them either. 

I hide a lot about myself. I’m a girl with a lot of body hair and the thought of someone ever seeing it or commenting on it is enough to make me have a panic attack. I’m so insecure and it makes this shit worse. My body hair also makes me feel like no one could ever be attracted to me.

Yesterday I woke up in an absolute panic. I don't even remember calling into work. I don't even know what I told them? All I know is that I didn't go into work and was freaking out at home. Couldn't calm down. I can't stop shaking. My hands are ticking, like tremors but only now and then.

Go to take out the garbage, and the bag is already out by the curb.

Last night, I couldn't sleep. Sweating profusely. Tossing and turning. Couldn't tell the difference between dreaming and reality. Woke up super confused several times, dreaming of work, and wake up to darkness... Had I gone to work after all? I don't remember. Shit. Did that stuff really happen, or was it a dream? I couldn't tell! So I freaked out even more. Oh my god. Did that stuff really happen? Why couldn't I remember?!

I spent all last night freaking out. I didn't tell my husband, because I didn't know what to say?

I had some things happen in my life about 2 years ago and after, was diagnosed with PTSD. In my head I thought that’s not possible, and ignored it. This past year really nailed it home tho, as I had several major heart attacks resulting in emergency triple bypass surgery, which I was given a 50/50 shot to survive, given 10% chance to survive an infection in the surgery site, then to have 2/3 bypasses fail requiring a stent and possibly more surgery to try to reopen the other artery. After all that the hospital recommended me talk to someone and THEY added post surgical PTSD to my new list of broken things. 

Backstory out of the way, I’ve been “handling” things ok, but tonight when my in-laws came home I had my MIL turn on the brightest lights in the house and YELL “WHY ARE YOU SITTING IN THE DARK?!?” ( I wasn’t, I was sitting in front of the tv relaxing with 3/4 lights on in the area).

I wouldn’t deride others for it, but I just thought it was some people’s way of getting attention (not everyone mind you)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some things happen in my life about 2 years ago and after, was diagnosed with PTSD. In my head I thought that’s not possible, and ignored it. This past year really nailed it home tho, as I had several major heart attacks resulting in emergency triple bypass surgery, which I was given a 50/50 shot to survive, given 10% chance to survive an infection in the surgery site, then to have 2/3 bypasses fail requiring a stent and possibly more surgery to try to reopen the other artery. After all that the hospital recommended me talk to someone and THEY added post surgical PTSD to my new list of broken things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backstory out of the way, I’ve been “handling” things ok, but tonight when my in-laws came home I had my MIL turn on the brightest lights in the house and YELL “WHY ARE YOU SITTING IN THE DARK?!?” ( I wasn’t, I was sitting in front of the tv relaxing with 3/4 lights on in the area). She turned the lights off when I winced since my eyes are sensitive to light.

I booked a holiday and planned for it to be the whole of this week, and stayed around a friend’s for the first night. Staying around his last minute-ish did ruin the hotel bookings I made and made alternative arrangements as a result, and chose a place that was cheap. It seemed nice from the website and upon settling in I honestly wasn’t a fan of the room. It smelled of smoke and I told myself that I’d stay away from it as much as possible during the next few days and enjoy my days out on holiday. So sure enough I spent a few hours in the city, took some photos, and made a return for my hotel in the evening. 

When I returned to the hotel in the evening, I kept thinking about how I’d have to return to that smoky room. The closer I approached it the more that feeling turned to dread and fear, and I had this uneasy feeling that something bad was going to happen. I can’t describe to you what I felt but I had this gut feeling that something wasn’t right and had this huge psychological inkling that something about that hotel wasn’t right and that I was either going to die in there or something horrible was going to happen, even though I rationally knew this feeling was stupid. I sat in my room and sat there on the bed for a moment as I tried to calm myself down, and I rang my parents to tell them how something here doesn’t feel right and how I need to get out. After some deliberation I packed up my stuff, left the keys at the front desk in the return box, and am now on the train home. I feel a huge sense of relief but also feel like crying at the same time. 

Well I learned my lesson to not book hotels so late and splash out a little more for a chain, but I feel like I’m losing my mind.

,Anxiety,"I'm an 18 year old male and for most of my life I have felt unsure and second guessed every small thing I do. I overthink all the time, I worry about everything and can be somewhat agressive for no reason.

I had never thought of this as a big problem, I thought it was something everyone goes through, but in my case it felt more extreme, yet I didn't think much about it. I always wanted to change but it's been hard and barely no progress because I have never known what to do. 

I got an online girlfriend almost exactly a year ago and I thought things would go better for me. I had been really lonely and wanted someone in my life who loves me and wants to be with me. I wanted something that wasn't just family/friends. I am super happy and I love her to death, and I still do up to this day. We have so much fun together and we try to video call every day. Even though I have her, I haven't gotten much better.

During our Discord video calls she is the one who leads the conversation and I've been happy with that since I'm not good at holding conversations myself. 
I don't share much about my life. I want to share, but for some reason I have a hard time doing so, even with really simple stuff like a story about a school trip in 4th grade, and also my feelings. I think that I think my girlfriend will find me boring and I'm scared she'll lose interest in me, but the real reason that would be happening is because I'm not sharing much at all so she doesn't have anything to be interested in. 

I'm writing this not long after I got off a call with her discussing this problem. We came to the conclusion that I need to change for us to stay together and that I need to check with a doctor if I really suffer from anxiety which I really think I do. I have wanted to change my whole life and finally I think I can do it. If we were to break up and I stayed like this, I would ruin any future relationships I got into.

I am determined to become a better person now, for both me and her. She loves me more than anything, but recently she has felt like she doesn't know me and is unsure if she can even call us boyfriend and girlfriend. Tomorrow I am going to talk to my mother about this and then schedule an appointment. I don't know how this will turn out and I'm really scared.

,Anxiety,"**For those that have overcome anxiety of various kinds, how did you do it?**

**For those that have not overcame it completely but are able to highly manage it, what did you do and why?**

**For those of you who are suffering, what is your plan to overcome it and what are you doing at the moment?**

My thoughts on anxiety is that it is a result of lifestyle circumstances based on past experience/choices. I feel as well that it is a result of this modern world of stimulation and sensitization. Our lives are generally more chaotic nowadays compared to the past, and we have primal instincts such as fight or flight that have no real use in society anymore for the most part. Our lives are largely based on survival, and we often ignore what our heart is telling us. We often stay in situations we don't like because it pays the bills or because its comfortable enough for us to scrape by.

**Anxiety is your body signalling to your mind or vice versa or both that there is some type of imbalance from within or from without in your lifestyle.**

I believe that to overcome anxiety we must become conscious and aware of what in life is holding us back, what is causing us stress, what is hurting our heart, what is hurting our mind/body, etc. I think that we must take advantage of our lifestyle to fix these problems. What we do daily will add up to our state of being and creates our future. You might wonder what you can do to begin calming down your mind and body.. well one thing that you can do is take action in all areas of life, *to the best of your ability*. Developing some type of connection with your spirit or a higher power, or even just some philosophy that you can live and abide your life by. Taking the steps to improving your mind, keeping a daily journal is a great example, or possibly some positive affirmations to reprogram the subconscious. Keeping a good diet and getting some type of regular exercise to the best of your ability. Taking natural supplements such as L-theanine or various other supplements. Sleeping regularly. Cutting out toxic people. Cutting out toxic habits. Trying therapy, to get to the root cause of some of these deeper psychological issues that create dis-ease within your being. These things can't all occur at once, but as you slowly detox every single area of your life you will notice the anxiety melting away. Your spirit/mind/body will recognize that you are now making steps to improve the situation, and you will calm down naturally given a certain amount of time. Be consistent with your efforts and most of all, remain patient.

***Many people are quick to cling to the label of having anxiety and becoming powerless to the situation. They focus on treating the symptoms without ever getting to the root cause. How many of us would still have anxiety if we could have a much more firm grasp on our lives and lifestyle and had an intention set to becoming our greatest version of our self? At the very least we would see improvements.***

,Anxiety,"I have struggled with anxiety for most of my life. But lately I have been experiencing a whole lot more anxiety the past 2-3 months, I didn’t think to look into it until recently because I thought it was just my stupid brain. But the more I think of it, the anxiety I’ve felt for the past few months is very different from my “regular anxiety”. I start to feel nervous and physically like I’m having anxiety but my thoughts are actually quite calm up until the physical symptoms get worse. 
I’m shaky and can’t stay still for very long, I’m having trouble sleeping because I can’t calm down physically (like I keep moving to much and I can’t lie down long enough to fall asleep until like 3-4am). 
I am losing weight, weight that I can’t afford to lose because I’m already underweight. And you would think that a person who is underweight would be cold and tired and weak but I’m not.

But lately I have been experiencing a whole lot more anxiety the past 2-3 months, I didn’t think to look into it until recently because I thought it was just my stupid brain. But the more I think of it, the anxiety I’ve felt for the past few months is very different from my “regular anxiety”. I start to feel nervous and physically like I’m having anxiety but my thoughts are actually quite calm up until the physical symptoms get worse. 
I’m shaky and can’t stay still for very long, I’m having trouble sleeping because I can’t calm down physically (like I keep moving to much and I can’t lie down long enough to fall asleep until like 3-4am). 
I am losing weight, weight that I can’t afford to lose because I’m already underweight. And you would think that a person who is underweight would be cold and tired and weak but I’m not. I am eating more than usual but I just keep losing weight.

,Anxiety,"Medication change

Hello all! I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but I don’t really know where else to post this. I also want to apologize for the long rant here. I just don’t know what to do. I suffer from pretty intense depression, anxiety, depersonalization and derealisation. I also have high blood pressure which i believe is anxiety derived, which I take atenolol 50mg a day for. I’ve recently been seeing a doctor to get medications for what I’m struggling with. I was taking venlafaxine 37.5mg everyday since November, and wasn’t really getting any results from it. I had an appointment with my doctor last Friday, I spoke to my doctor and vocalized that this medication didn’t seem to be helping me. She said that it probably wasn’t the right medication for me, and switched me from this to Buproprion hcl XL 150mg for depression, and also put me on Buspirone hcl 5mg for anxiety. I started taking these the day that I saw my doctor for the appointment. Until yesterday, I didn’t notice any difference, and felt the same. Yesterday, I was at work and was feeling increasingly anxious and sick, so I went home early. Once I got home, I started feeling extremely anxious and I was unable to sleep. I felt like I was having heart palpitations. I decided to go for a walk and try to get my mind off of it. It helped me a bit, but I was up all night and through the morning feeling this way. I called my doctor and told Her the symptoms that I’ve been experiencing, and she scheduled me for an EKG. I asked if it was normal to be feeling this was after the medication changes, and she just advised me to drink lots of water. I feel like I’m losing my mind, I’m so anxious and I feel like I cannot sit still or function, is any of this normal?

,Anxiety,"Hi guys before i start writing i need to mention that english is not my primary language, so in advance i apologise for any grammatical mistakes, and i'm going to tell probably really long story so yeah sorry for that haha.

So lately i have been having this really painful anxiety. This anxiety comes up when i think of this girl i met on instagram approximately 2 years ago. When we started to message each other every single day it was amazing like i really started to like her, but then i realise we started to fight a lot. This cycle would repeat for almost two years: we talk, we fight, i get angry, i block her, we don't talk for couple of weeks, i follow her again, and the cycle repeat.

Firstly, we started as a couple then our relationship changed into friendship *i got friendzoned, press f haha*, at first i was fine with that, because i was atleast talking to her, honestly i thought i was able to get her to like me again.

2 years have passed, and that cycle i mention above was continuing as well. Last time or to be more precise in november when we were talking i told her that i was really sick and tired of me being her friend and listening to her adventures with the other guys like it was really painful to listen * i probably sound now like a pathetic bitch, but i like to be honest with my life stories let's put it that way*, she told me that she liked me as well in a weird way, but still doesn't want me as her boyfriend, i told her that i need to stop talking with her, luckily this time she was actually really nice, because before she would get angry if i said something that she didn't like, that was the main reason we fought, i felt like i didn't have freedom of speech with her, but like i said this time she was actually really nice.

2 months forward and i relapsed let's say, she posted story on ig and i replied *bare in mind this time i didn't block her, we just stopped talking* she was happy i reached to her and we started to talk again, but this time i was acting sometimes arrogant, before i was ""nice guy"" i mean i think i still am, but when i talk with her i'm acting like a bad boy ifykwim. Also, i started to mention that i talk with other girls but like discretely not like ""hey bitch i have this other girls haha"" like not that.
I started to see that she was really jealous like really then she started saying that she loves me and similair things like that, but i started to get confused and one part of my anxiety is this, we used to say things like that to each other before, now i don't know does she really means that?

Other part that is really fucking me in the head is because now i think that she is genuine, what if we stopped talking again, what if i blocked her and couldn't see what is she doing, i feel like she is my drug i can't get off, when it really hits me hard is when i think she found someone else who she is telling ""i love you"", ""baby"", and similair things like that, like i really have this intrusive thought of me being 35 and single and still thinking about her, and her adventures, but knowing i will never get to hear about them.

The last year and a half have been hell on me and my family. I have been getting worse and worse. I suspect that I have some form of anxiety disorder and PTSD.  
I believe my trauma lies in a medical event that happened 5 years ago.

Some background info - I have GAD, and I'd been off meds for a few months trying out new coping mechanisms. Worked for a while, then I took a dive that's put a lot of strain on my marriage. Been back on meds for a few days. Obviously, the overall air of exhaustion/defeat hasn't yet lifted from our household. Meanwhile, my best friend (very close to both of us) has recovered from World's Most Prolonged Break-up, and she's finally doing really well. She's back to her exciting, spontaneous, fun self.

The best part is, she and my husband have gotten closer over the past few months, both supporting each other through their rough stuff (her break up, my spiral). I trust them both, and I know they love me more than they care about each other, but that hasn't stopped me from being jealous.

Also relevant - I recently passed the bar and have my character interview coming up soon.

So...this weekend. This goddamn nightmare awful weekend.

The 3 of us had been planning on seeing a show for weeks. The weekend started with her not answering our texts about whether we had tickets for the earlier show or later show. She just responded with kind of joking messages , and we wrote it off as like well, it must be the later show (she's generally really good at planning, so if it was the earlier show she'd have approached the plans differently). Didn't stop me from waking up in panic-mode the next day, however. I thought she was mad at me for not answering her texts earlier in the week (bc anxiety), and was fucking with me. Husband calmed me down, I got over it.

The plan was for us to get to her place around 3:30-4, she was cooking us dinner, and we'd leave for the show at 6:30. We get there at 4. She finally shows up at 5:30, but she's excited and makes us food and brought fun outfits, so we just shake off the frustration, start drinking and having a good time. I get pretty drunk.

Fast forward to the show - we show up late, and we're stopped at the door. Turns out she got tickets for the wrong night. She decides to see if we can sneak in, despite my protests. She dips and calls us, saying hey its fine I was able to sneak through. I'm furious. She KNOWS about my anxiety about that kind of shit, and my interview coming up. They BOTH do. But I'm trying to be a good sport, I say fine. We sneak through. We are promptly caught. We tell them we're looking for our friend, we call her, she's on the other side of the arena. The guards start walking us around looking for her so she can show them our tickets.

After walking around looking for her for what seemed like forever, I begin to have a panic attack. Everything is suddenly too loud. People are glaring at us. We're walking around endlessly looking for a person who I know doesn't have legit tickets. I don't even remember things that well from that point because my world was just spinning. But I was told later that we were like a section away, like one more left turn away from her, when I decide that I'm out.

I tell my husband that we're leaving. That I need to go. Now. We walk out, past big signs saying No Re-Entry.

To say he was pissed at me is an understatement.

We spent the next 10-20 minutes outside trying to get an uber. We were in a spot with shitty reception, in a not-great part of town, and I'm still kind of drunk and just trying to keep it together. At one point my friend came to meet us at the door and had almost talked a security guard into letting us back in, but he wasn't doing it and I was just like - fuck this. Fuck you guys. We are leaving. We left. She ended up staying another 15-20 minutes before leaving and meeting us back at her place. She spent a good part of the next few hours apologizing, but ultimately ended up going out again. Husband almost went with her, except I asked him to stay.

I get that they're both tired of taking care of me. I get it. I get that my husband just wants to have fun, and that that's all they were thinking about that night. Having a good time. That was their #1 and only priority. They're 100% convinced nothing bad could have possibly happened from us getting caught sneaking in. My husband thinks my friend was a badass who did nothing wrong. To him, the sole reason he didn't see the show was because of my anxiety.

I'm still just so...angry. I'm angry that she blew off our texts (if she had checked the tickets when we asked she would have seen that she bought the wrong ones and this all could have been avoided). I'm angry that she made us wait for for an hour and a half. I'm angry that my husband feels like this whole situation was the result of my anxiety, and that she did nothing wrong. I'm angry at how insecure I am right now, and how I feel like he's just constantly comparing us and I'm the one who comes up short.

I love her, and our friendship is a huge part of my life. But I honestly feel like, I had been looking forward to getting some goddamn relief going back on meds, and getting my life back. And now I just keep flashing back to the peak-panic moments of that night and I feel the weight of his blame and I get mad all over again. I don't know how to talk to either of them about it.

,Anxiety,"hi, id like some advice if that’s possible. i suffer from extreme anxiety due to environmental and emotional stressors. this makes it extremely difficult to physically sit down and complete schoolwork before the deadline. i also miss a lot of classes because i am scared of confrontation.

just yesterday i submitted a late essay assigned a few weeks back that was half assed and didn’t even meet the page number requirements. this just perpetuates the existing anxiety because now i have to face the teacher tomorrow morning and possibly be questioned about my quality of work. i have a 504 plan but the thought of asking for extensions or additional help makes me feel pathetic.

anxiety + depression + an untreated eating disorder has caused my grades to falter ever since the start of last year . i am a senior in high school and am deathly afraid of being deferred from the colleges that i have been accepted to. the fact that i can’t keep up with high school work suggests that ill fail at college too

i’ve started becoming suicidal due to this. body dysmorphia makes it difficult just to step outside of my house. i have no friends, i am lonely and comfort myself with food, which i usually throw up after. the only people willing to listen to me are adults who are paid to do so

&lt;p&gt;just yesterday i submitted a late essay assigned a few weeks back that was half assed and didn’t even meet the page number requirements. this just perpetuates the existing anxiety because now i have to face the teacher tomorrow morning and possibly be questioned about my quality of work. i have a 504 plan but the thought of asking for extensions or additional help makes me feel pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anxiety + depression + an untreated eating disorder has caused my grades to falter ever since the start of last year . i am a senior in high school and am deathly afraid of being deferred from the colleges that i have been accepted to. the fact that i can’t keep up with high school work suggests that ill fail at college too&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’ve started becoming suicidal due to this. body dysmorphia makes it difficult just to step outside of my house. i have no friends, i am lonely and comfort myself with food, which i usually throw up after. the only people willing to listen to me are adults who are paid to do so&lt;/p&gt;

I've suffered anxiety and depression since I was around 15. After a few years on an off meds, and a few sessions of CBT, I thought I had it beaten. My confidence was back, I wasn't worrying about every little thing, it went on like this for a good 6 months or so (after my most recent CBT was ongoing for 6 months itself.)

The last couple of months these unwanted thoughts have crept back in, to the extent where I was having a full blown panic/anxiety attack last night that lasted well over an hour, probably closer to two. I don't really remember much of it, but I know I ended up thinking about any recent social interaction I'd had recently, especially with new people, crying (I think?) And having some darker thoughts (I don't think I need to spell this out for you.)

I don't know what to do. I'm reluctant to admit defeat and go back to the doctor, but it's affecting most aspects of my life, and the fog that descends with it is almost completely overwhelming at times, but the darker thoughts are surprisingly strong and difficult to overlook at the moment.

This is the knowingness that you are always loved and that there is nothing that you need to forgive cause you’re already free by nature.

Our perceptions will play tricks to us by making us believe that “separation” is real, this will create in the mind the need of love because we now believe that is missing

Other times we feel an inability to forgive, this happens because we’re attached to the past experiences, we don’t want to let go of them cause they “define” us

Try to bring Awareness in the bodily sensation of tension and dive deep in the emotional pain, here we’re simply exploring while resting more and more into Awareness, which is never affected by any emotions or thoughts

,Anxiety,"Lately I've been getting annoyed with trigger warnings in books. Not so much the idea of of having them, I think it's necessary to let readers know if the book contains upsetting/troubling subject matter.

The issue I have with them is that the author will add something along the lines of:

""If you are dealing with a mental health condition at the moment, wait until you feel better OR JUST DON'T READ THIS BOOK AT ALL""


As someone who has had anxiety issues, I find this a little demeaning: I mean, does the fact that I have anxiety mean I'm unable to enjoy a perfectly good piece of literature? I won't get a panic attack just by reading about one. 

I know this isn't the case for some people, and I am by no means saying that's wrong or anything. 

I just think that trying to bar someone from reading a book because of a mental health condition adds to the stigma, since it implies that those of us with a mental illness are unable to do anything without getting ""triggered"".

Maybe they could reword it to:
""This book contains sensitive subject matter about mental illness. If this makes you uncomfortable or if you think this could be a potential trigger for you,  think carefully before reading. Or, if you want, you can decide not to read this book at all.""

This gives you more choice over your own mental health than someone telling you outright what to do.

I’ve been struggling with workplace related anxiety since mid 2014, I sought help for it in 2018 but this last six months is really wrecking me.

I’m in fruit/vegetable exports in Australia with an hyper critical yet benevolent boss and seemingly a long cycle of claims on arrivals whether they be market claims/quality claims or even just customers not paying because they won’t/can’t.

My job is as a grower liaison and also a trader in my own right, and even though I do a lot of good work, when things go bad I bear the brunt, and I just can’t seem to dig myself out of the hole.

Any ideas on how to get that sick feeling in my stomach to stop?

Is it just not caring anymore?  Is the part that makes me good at my job making me sick as I am a genuine person who does care and I do build personable relationships with our suppliers.

,Anxiety,"Sorry... super long post

Hello! I want to ask for some advice in comforting someone with social anxiety.

I am diagnosed with GAD and my anxiety is mostly health-related, and not so much of social anxiety, so I am at lost how to make my friend feel better.

Basically, I have a group of really tight knit friends, we hang out a lot online and the group has been really healthy and harmonic. (no drama, no toxicity) 

But one of us... he would always try to exclude himself from us, saying things like he doesn’t deserve us, he is the worst person in the world, we don’t need him, we are better off without him — things like that

It happened a very good handful of times, and every time it would take us a good hour to make him stop. Then he comes back and hang out again, rinse and repeat.

At times like that, I feel lost and I don’t know what to say except denying what he’s saying and that we are so happy to have him part of the group — and I feel like I’m doing it wrong. 

I feel like, if he already feels so shitty about himself, and if I tell him how much we like him, he’s just going to feel even shittier? (As he always says that “he doesn’t deserve us”)

I’m having troubles explaining the situation... but if there’s anyone who could kindly give some advice of how to soothe a person suffering social anxiety situations, I really appreciate the tips!!

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I have a group of really tight knit friends, we hang out a lot online and the group has been really healthy and harmonic. (no drama, no toxicity) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one of us... he would always try to exclude himself from us, saying things like he doesn’t deserve us, he is the worst person in the world, we don’t need him, we are better off without him — things like that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happened a very good handful of times, and every time it would take us a good hour to make him stop. Then he comes back and hang out again, rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times like that, I feel lost and I don’t know what to say except denying what he’s saying and that we are so happy to have him part of the group — and I feel like I’m doing it wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like, if he already feels so shitty about himself, and if I tell him how much we like him, he’s just going to feel even shittier? (As he always says that “he doesn’t deserve us”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m having troubles explaining the situation... but if there’s anyone who could kindly give some advice of how to soothe a person suffering social anxiety situations, I really appreciate the tips!! Thank you so much!&lt;/p&gt;

Basically, I just feel like I am terrible at everything.

,Anxiety,"**Possible Trigger Warning:  nightmares related to trauma, abuse, stalking, and gaslighting**

Throwaway because some co-workers know my reddit account.

Last night was surreal and I need to vent. I called off work and used a sick day a bit ago because I'm so sleep deprived and shaken up, and unfortunately my anxiety tends to lead to IBS flare-ups so I've literally been shitting my pants for like 4 hours now. But I feel guilty about making my co-workers work short handed because I am feeling a bit more myself now, but was definitely not at 5 am and we have to give 2 hour notice for sick days so I was like welp it's now or never. I'm just overwhelmed.

I woke up around midnight last night after the first nightmare in an absolute panic, sweating, rushed to the bathroom with stomach cramps. Every time I fell asleep I had the same, awful, vivid dream.

A man that would come through the windows and try to hurt me. He had this American Psycho look on his face. I kept calling the cops but no one would come. I would open the door screaming for help and bystanders would just look at me. If I ran he ran towards me, if I backed up slowly watching him holding a knife in self defense or something, he approached slowly. He would be saying shit like ""why are you running, I would never hurt you, why are you acting crazy"" He always matched my speed but always got closer and closer until he was on top of me with a weapon at which point I'd wake up screaming and look at the clock - 20-30 minutes. At one point I managed to impale him through the skull and he just laughed and said ""Ow, good try though"" and got to me again.

Eventually I started having sleep paralysis too, and things got really weird and dream like even when I was waking up. I would wake up but only be able to open my eyes but not move for a while, and I would still hear windows opening and doors rattling like he was coming for me in real life now. Every time I finally woke up my cat was next to me staring at me with dinner plate eyes, and at one point I thought she was an evil spiritual overlord controlling my mind and screamed ""NO STOP"" threw her onto the floor (I'm SO sorry kitty)

At one point I remember I escaped and ran to the police station (and had convinced myself that this was in real life too now and no longer the dreams) and they offered me the ""protection program"" where I could transfer my consciousness to a guppy in this ""guppy farm."" I wouldn't remember I was a human, but it would still have my personality, and that way I can live on while my parents mourn my body. They could come to the guppy farm and my little guppy self would come interact with them because I would retain some semblance of memory (but at a fish's level, so like places, people, things being familiar)

I woke up from this one, again with sleep paralysis, and looked over and my cat was back next to me just staring at me still like she was concerned. Went to text my boss half in my dream state ""I can't come in today because someone is trying to murder me and I need to go to the FBI because the cops don't care"" until I got my full bearings once I turned my phone screen on and actual reality came flooding back to me, and was like wait no what the heck. Have stayed up since dealing with this stress IBS flareup and shaking.

**Tl;Dr: my dream stalker is unrelenting in his gaslighting and persistence of murdering me, sleep paralysis sucks, my cat is not actually an evil spiritual overlord, I'm not going to the Black Mirror esque guppy farm, felt like I was in Alice in Wonderland for like 4 hours.

,Anxiety,"To keep a long post as short as possible, I, like many others have been suffering from physical anxiety for about 5 months now... I have some decent days but it's mostly horrible. I am trying to do everything I'm told, like going out for walks, exercising, yoga, mindfulness and breathing techniques, etc... And none seem to have done shit. Exercise actually makes my physical symptoms worse, mainly my chest pain,especially explosive workouts where I get my heart up to 150bpm... In the past, I never had this issue. I used to have horrible intrusive thoughts, and would simply be worrying A LOT and had a hard time concentrating... Now? Well funny enough, I can concentrate no problem, I barely, if ever have intrusive thoughts and images, and I'm actually willing to explore more on my own, and visit different countries... I'm currently enroute to another country to visit all alone and I don't feel anxious or scared, but my physical symptoms clearly say otherwise... If this was 2 years ago, I would definitely not be trekking all by myself. So, i'm exposing myself to what used to be my worst fears, exploring on my own in this case... Yet, I just simply don't get it, I feel worse. I was trying to avoid meds, since my job technically doesn't allow me to be on them, but I really don't care at this point... If they will help, I will go back on them (had very short stints on Zoloft, and it helped). I know I need CBT, but it's almost impossible to get an appointment for the free counselors (I'm in Canada) and the private ones are just too expensive. I just want this to be over or to minimize, so I can enjoy the things around me again...

,Anxiety,"I first suffered from anxiety attacks at the age of 20 when I was in college. And they were severe. I won't go into long descriptions, most of you know it all, unfortunately... It took me over a year of self-help and some medication to get well, really well. That lasted for almost 10 years. That is until I got this job I've been doing since 3 years ago.

For the past year especially, my anxiety returned abruptly and in some new and less-than-exciting ways. It started with severe vertigo and nausea. I was sent to do an x-ray and to go see a neurologist. They gave me mild sedatives that still help. However, for the last 5 or 6 months, the symptoms have become more regular and vary from restlessness, feeling on edge, irritability, tiredness, dizziness, muscle tension, trembling, sleep difficulty and migraines to a general feeling of dread. I don't have all of the symptoms all the time, obviously. But sometimes, I feel bad whole day long. Like yesterday. And today.

I think about my job ALL THE TIME, and I mean ALL THE TIME. Even when I'm at home with my husband, I constantly talk about work situations and relive them. I'm overworked, over-stressed and no one in the company cares about that or about other people who feel this enormous pressure to keep the numbers up. There is a clear hierarchy and for us who are at the bottom, things are bad. The salary alone is the lowest even though some of us have higher education degrees. The relationships between people are those of fake pleasantry and general disregard for emotion. I'm given new tasks constantly and then get reprimanded when I don't finish them all promptly - which is impossible with this kind of workload. I'm getting angrier and angrier.

I started volunteering as an English teacher at the city library a month ago and today I feel completely sick and I've canceled the workshops and tutoring sessions. I couldn't handle it. The volunteering overall helped me and I've been reading a lot more since I'd got my MA last October. But still, I generally feel bad. I'm sorry if my post makes someone else feel bad.

,Anxiety,"Hello,

I'm a 40 years old woman who recently moved from her country to another, so please be patient with my English. Soon after the moving, my anxiety that I have since forever got worse, so I searched for help and I've found it. My therapist (who speaks my same language) was amazing and after one year I felt so much better, I even understood things about my childhood and the relationship with my parents and this made me free from some very negative emotions that I used to feel. The problem now is that I can't find a job because I totally lost my self-confidence after a very painful dismissal that ended with lawyers and other unpleasant things. I've tried to not feel depressed so I started freelancing, but the job itself (you receive lots of no) and my bad attitude mixed to my critical inner voice and my not-so-great-English made me fall in a sort of laziness/paralysis.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 40 years old woman who recently moved from her country to another, so please be patient with my English. Soon after the moving, my anxiety that I have since forever got worse, so I searched for help and I&amp;#39;ve found it. My therapist (who speaks my same language) was amazing and after one year I felt so much better, I even understood things about my childhood and the relationship with my parents and this made me free from some very negative emotions that I used to feel. The problem now is that I can&amp;#39;t find a job because I totally lost my self-confidence after a very painful dismissal that ended with lawyers and other unpleasant things. I&amp;#39;ve tried to not feel depressed so I started freelancing, but the job itself (you receive lots of no) and my bad attitude mixed to my critical inner voice and my not-so-great-English made me fall in a sort of laziness/paralysis. I even sabotaged my self: I&amp;#39;ve found an agent who wanted to represent me, I&amp;#39;ve replied but never sent what he required and I don&amp;#39;t know why. I really don&amp;#39;t understand why I can&amp;#39;t apply for a job and just try, but every time I say myself okay, tomorrow you&amp;#39;ll do it, nothing happens, most of the time I just lay in bed.

,Anxiety," 

It’s been about 3 months since I’ve had an anxiety attack like this... I’m sitting on this couch in a ball and all I can move is my arms. I’m stuck. I’ve embarrassed my self. I want to be Home. I wish I had the words to explain what this feels like but honestly there no words no amount of explaining that can truly describe what it's like… for me I feel like I’ve been hit by a train going 200km, my whole body hurts to the point where I can’t move or breathe. but during that, my mind is going every direction possible, like I’m just standing in a tunnel with 100km winds but the wind is my thoughts. It's all happening so fast that I can’t even form a sentence, I physically can’t get words out of my mouth. It's terrifying. I've almost died a few times in my life. I always thought that the feeling of thinking it is your last breathe you’ll ever take was the worst feeling. That's what these attacks feel like. You get to a point where you just feel like this is the last breath you’ll ever take. Its kinda like your brain has overloaded or gotten a virus like a computer and starts to shut down. It just can’t keep up. there's not much I can do about them when they start. As a kid they got so bad that my bottom jaw would shake like I was shivering but 10x worse and then for the rest of that day I couldn’t eat or drink because my jaw was numb from the attack. My mom for the longest time didn’t understand until finally one day she did. It got to a point where they just couldn’t help me anymore so they pumped me full of drugs until I was asleep. I sleep for 8 hours and then id be ok enough to talk. this was every day for years. I failed 7th grade because of it. because getting out of being the hardest thing I could do. I was mentally and physically exhausted from fighting every second. And if I did step outta bed id have an attack. And the days I did make it to school didn’t last very long because within 1 minute of sitting there I would have an attack and have to leave. Tonight's attack was mild I could still kinda talk and could move a bit which I'm thankful for because full-on attack is scary and often ends with me in the hospital. I wish there was some way for people to truly understand what’s happening and what it feels like but there’s not. So I just get through my days the best I can. Shit happens, but with some time and help, I will be ok again. honestly, it feels like your dying, that’s the best way to explain it. After an attack, I’m so emotionally and physically and mentally drained that I’m very sensitive in the such that one wrong move one wrong word can send in back into a panic so I separate my self from the world Long enough you regain the strength to function like a normal person.

,Anxiety,"So here’s some background. I went to community college after high school for 2.5 years. I recently transferred to a 4 year college last month. I’m still attending and it’s been like hell for me. I don’t like the pressure of being told to find an internship. The reason I don’t like it is that one of my orientation leaders at the orientation said I and the rest of the transfer students are statistically behind. That put me really down. One of my professor (who’s also the dean of students for the business school I’m in) for a class that helps students build resumes, cover letters, build a linkedin, etc. said that recruiters are looking at my class now and that if I wanted an internship I should get to it since I’m late, but I just transferred over. I’m positive she has immense pressure to make sure students from the school are the BEST but I feel so pressured to find an internship, go to school and then get a job by the time I’m a senior.  This made me fall into a hole. I’m still in that hole. That hole was that idk if Im meant for this whole college thing but I also don’t know if I have the capabilities to learn anything on my own. I don’t like the path schools taking me. Just the fact that they setup “networking parties”. To me that seems a little off, just talk to people and call it a regular party. It’s like these people don’t know how to act like a human being.  

I want to do a variety of  things; 
videography, YouTube gaming, grow a potential business with my father, and also start a business a friend and I are really into.

I’ve been wanting to do YouTube gaming for so long and I’m doing it now. It feels great but I’m too scared to go at it hard since I don’t wanna mess up college. I feel like I’m lazy and just all talk when it comes to saying “college doesn’t HAVE to be the path” but I do wanna try out these goals of mine but i feel like I’m pressed for time, I feel worthless, that I’ve been going through life just going with the flow, kind of just doing what’s expected of me and now I’m confused.

It's all happening so fast that I can’t even form a sentence, I physically can’t get words out of my mouth. It's terrifying. I've almost died a few times in my life. I always thought that the feeling of thinking it is your last breathe you’ll ever take was the worst feeling. That's what these attacks feel like. You get to a point where you just feel like this is the last breath you’ll ever take. Its kinda like your brain has overloaded or gotten a virus like a computer and starts to shut down. It just can’t keep up. there's not much I can do about them when they start. As a kid they got so bad that my bottom jaw would shake like I was shivering but 10x worse and then for the rest of that day I couldn’t eat or drink because my jaw was numb from the attack. My mom for the longest time didn’t understand until finally one day she did. It got to a point where they just couldn’t help me anymore so they pumped me full of drugs until I was asleep. I sleep for 8 hours and then id be ok enough to talk. this was every day for years. I failed 7th grade because of it. because getting out of being the hardest thing I could do. I was mentally and physically exhausted from fighting every second. And if I did step outta bed id have an attack. And the days I did make it to school didn’t last very long because within 1 minute of sitting there I would have an attack and have to leave. Tonight's attack was mild I could still kinda talk and could move a bit which I'm thankful for because full-on attack is scary and often ends with me in the hospital. I wish there was some way for people to truly understand what’s happening and what it feels like but there’s not. So I just get through my days the best I can. Shit happens, but with some time and help, I will be ok again. honestly, it feels like your dying, that’s the best way to explain it. After an attack, I’m so emotionally and physically and mentally drained that I’m very sensitive in the such that one wrong move one wrong word can send in back into a panic so I separate my self from the world Long enough you regain the strength to function like a normal person.

,Anxiety,"Anxiety is annoying.


My mind has been infiltrated by a tiny critic or maybe many with amplified speaker phones. 


Each one there to criticise a different part of myself. My body. My face. My voice.

Each and every thing I say recorded and ready to be replayed and over analysed for weeks to come. Making me afraid to open my mouth for fear of what my inner critic will do to the words. The way it twists and turns them, creating a thousand different ways someone else may interpret them. 


The frustration this guy gives me makes me want to reach inside my brain and rip him from his little sound booth and take his power away.


But no. Instead, I can’t do that. Because for some reason that silly little critic is a part of me. Something I have created over the years, slowly perfecting my own hell with absolutely no possible escape other than distractions and sleep.


My phone, becomes my crutch. Music, my only true escape. The stories music provides, lives I will never fully understand while being stuck in my head and the happiness music can create with a few beats and a poppy tune. Giving me a sigh of relief everytime I listen knowing that I can still feel happy and calm. 


Will the critic ever take a break from his job? Or will I have to continue to get my peace by drowning him out with music? 


Peace. An interesting word isn’t it? Some use it to describe how quiet a certain area may be, others describe it to signify the end of a big war overseas, but then there are those of us who crave it in our minds. A sense of peace to end the war in our heads.

,Anxiety," I can talk/act moderately freely in school, at least in most places in school. And I'm *almost* free of excess self consciousness at home, most of the time. But outside of those two places, I can't do shit. My head's always down to the point where I sometimes can't even see where I'm going, I can't talk to people, I can barely respond when they talk to me, etc. I can't even order a meal at a restaurant, not easily. On some rare days, it's even hard for me to eat in front of people I don't know at all.

This has always been something I could live around growing up, but now I'm borderline adult and can't for the life of me (literally) muster up the confidence to get a job, or learn to drive (for fear of having to buy things  when my parents make me or having to *talk* to somebody at a gas station), or any other stuff. 

My parents no longer put any effort into changing this. They once did, whenever we went out somewhere- restaurant, haircut, whatever- and disliked my shyness. I'm afraid of explaining any of this to them, though they have the vague idea that I'm shy.  The day where I have to go somewhere actually public (not like school) on my own is getting closer and I'm slowly getting more worried that I can't function.

Last thing: this seems to be very random. In some classes I feel more free and can walk around, talk to people, use facial expressions, etc. In others, I sometimes sit for several minutes just to convince myself to get up to sharpen a pencil. Sometimes I feel mostly confident and able, and others I feel dangerously incapable. I don't actually consider people's reactions to what I do, not to the degree of anxiety, but for some reason doing anything that makes me seem alive and not like a background wallpaper often seems scary. I'm afraid of the attention of strangers, and though I know I can act well enough around them when forced to, I'm really avoidant of intentionally interacting with new people and have no idea how to change this.

Possibly related stuff: I have minor tics and moderate compulsions, some of which I know came from social anxiety but certainly not all of them. I struggle a lot with comprehending emotions and more so with explaining them. I struggle to be empathetic for pretty much anyone.

,Anxiety,"I’ve finally realized that my mood is directly linked to my perception of myself depending on the filter I see through. It will dramatically shift from day to day, and sometimes hour to hour. It will make me feel like a freak who people want to avoid, then shift to being hopeful.

,Anxiety,"I'm sorry if my posts are becoming annoying, I can't talk about this to anyone irl so I keep turning to Reddit. I like to think of these subs as sort of support groups. Also this is going to be very long, so no judgment for skipping. It's good for me to write it all down anyway.

Basically, I took my first dose of Effexor and had a not so good time with it. I think I'm finally back to normal now, so I'm gonna try to go over these side effects and see if I can understand them a bit more.

14.00 Yesterday after some deliberation I took the pill. Didn't really feel anything so I decided to go to the store (pretty stupid tbh).

14.30 Came home, was unpacking the groceries when suddenly I felt like I couldn't breath properly, this was accompanied by a heat wave, racing heart and an overall weird feeling in my body. It was unlike anything I've felt before and I became convinced I was having an allergic reaction to the medicine. *Do I call my housemates for help? Get a taxi to the hospital? Will I die here because I'm too anxious to call for help?*

I tried what I always do when I feel shortness of breath due to anxiety (but it's never this bad), I laid down and attempted some breathing exercises. Soon I realized that I could indeed breath.

Looking back now, I wonder if this was a panic attack? I have a fear of suffocating from some allergic reaction (*ironically, as far as I know I don't have any allergies*). I think Effexor gave me more anxiety which lead to a panic attack, which I've never had before.

14.45-18.00 I started thinking that maybe the weird thing was something with my heart, especially after seeing a review from some woman who claimed she almost had a heart attack on this drug. I was afraid to move too much so I figured I'd just stay in bed and watch stuff to calm down. At this point I also started feeling nausea, which was not severe but constant and lasted *up until a few hours of me writing this now*.

18.00 I was feeling much better, especially after taking some ginger for the nausea. *I've got this,* I thought to myself\*.\* I even got out of bed for a bit.

22.00 Since I was supposed to have work the next morning, and I was feeling very sleepy, I went to bed.

01.00 I woke up very suddenly and sat up, only to realize that *my entire body was numb*. I could move, but my body was moving with a delay from my brain, like it wasn't my body at all. *I'm dying,* I thought, *this is it. Do I call for help? Am I even able to call for help?*

And suddenly it passed. I was in agreement with my body once again. I felt the panic thing from before so I quickly laid back down.

I was scared, but somehow managed to fall back asleep. I was cursing these meds in my head, promising myself I would never take them again if I survived this (*sounds dramatic, but I was very panicky at the time*).

02.00 Woke up again and my head was spinning. I'd only experienced something similar after drinking. My mind jumped to medical emergencies again, but this too passed quickly.

02.00-05.00 Was spent coming in and out of sleep, feeling slightly disconnected from my body and constantly switching between being very hot and very cold. My brain wasn't really working, it was a little similar to being drunk. I was thinking - *Is this supposed to be the good part? I won't be anxious because my brain will feel like this?*

05.00 I was supposed to wake up for work... except only 3 hours ago I'd woken up convinced I was dying. I experimented. Went to brush my teeth (*which made me nauseous*), then went to get some food. I figured if I could eat, I could work (*I couldn't eat*). Otherwise I was feeling fine... well as long as I didn't try walking too much.

I cancelled that shift (still don't know if I haven't lost my job).

At 14.00 I realized I hadn't eaten in 24 hours. I still had no appetite and was feeling nauseous, so I went to grab some cereal. And that cereal was *freaking loud*, the sound it made while I was chewing was almost physically painful. Also I noticed some discoordination. I spilled water on myself multiple times, dropped a few things and managed to spill some of that cereal on myself. *I'm not that clumsy.*

18.00 I was chilling in bed (on reddit literally all day), when suddenly I felt very sick and started shaking. But at this point I wasn't on edge anymore, so instead of panicking I realized it was probably from not eating and not the Effexor. Still no appetite, so I swallowed yet another ginger pill and quickly ate a bunch of snacks I had lying around. It passed.

23.00 It's been 33 hours since I took my first Effexor pill, and I just started feeling like myself again. Looking back I don't even remember much of yesterday other than the times I had bad symptoms, it's a mix of nausea and anxiety. I've decided not to risk taking a second one now, I can't afford to make myself bed ridden for 2 more days. Maybe I'll give it a shot over the weekend when I'll have more free days ahead.

To be honest I'm terrified of putting myself through this again. Looking back, I think a lot of it was anxiety and panic. Although I have no idea what the 1 AM freak out was about, that was the scariest bit. Also I hope my appetite comes back at some point soon, until then I'll have to manually remember to eat, which I usually suck at.

I applaud you if you read all this. If you are here because you're gonna start Effexor or some other antidepressant please don't take my word for it. There are just as many success stories out there as there are ones like mine. Everyone reacts differently, and as someone pointed out in my other thread it was probably a shock to my system because for some reason I was prescribed a high dose to start with.",t2_3jbj950n,False,,0,False,"My detailed experience with taking Effexor for the first time, better don't read if you're about to take it",[],r/Anxiety,False,1,medsflair,0,,False,t3_fcl83k,False,dark,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Medication,False,3,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1583220682.0,text,1,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry if my posts are becoming annoying, I can&amp;#39;t talk about this to anyone irl so I keep turning to Reddit.

&lt;p&gt;01.00 I woke up very suddenly and sat up, only to realize that &lt;em&gt;my entire body was numb&lt;/em&gt;. I could move, but my body was moving with a delay from my brain, like it wasn&amp;#39;t my body at all. &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m dying,&lt;/em&gt; I thought, &lt;em&gt;this is it. Do I call for help? Am I even able to call for help?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And suddenly it passed. I was in agreement with my body once again. I felt the panic thing from before so I quickly laid back down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was scared, but somehow managed to fall back asleep. I was cursing these meds in my head, promising myself I would never take them again if I survived this (&lt;em&gt;sounds dramatic, but I was very panicky at the time&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;02.00 Woke up again and my head was spinning. I&amp;#39;d only experienced something similar after drinking. My mind jumped to medical emergencies again, but this too passed quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;02.00-05.00 Was spent coming in and out of sleep, feeling slightly disconnected from my body and constantly switching between being very hot and very cold. My brain wasn&amp;#39;t really working, it was a little similar to being drunk. I was thinking - &lt;em&gt;Is this supposed to be the good part? I won&amp;#39;t be anxious because my brain will feel like this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;05.00 I was supposed to wake up for work... except only 3 hours ago I&amp;#39;d woken up convinced I was dying. I experimented. Went to brush my teeth (&lt;em&gt;which made me nauseous&lt;/em&gt;), then went to get some food. I figured if I could eat, I could work (&lt;em&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t eat&lt;/em&gt;). Otherwise I was feeling fine... well as long as I didn&amp;#39;t try walking too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cancelled that shift (still don&amp;#39;t know if I haven&amp;#39;t lost my job).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 14.00 I realized I hadn&amp;#39;t eaten in 24 hours. I still had no appetite and was feeling nauseous, so I went to grab some cereal. And that cereal was &lt;em&gt;freaking loud&lt;/em&gt;, the sound it made while I was chewing was almost physically painful. Also I noticed some discoordination. I spilled water on myself multiple times, dropped a few things and managed to spill some of that cereal on myself. &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m not that clumsy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18.00 I was chilling in bed (on reddit literally all day), when suddenly I felt very sick and started shaking. But at this point I wasn&amp;#39;t on edge anymore, so instead of panicking I realized it was probably from not eating and not the Effexor. Still no appetite, so I swallowed yet another ginger pill and quickly ate a bunch of snacks I had lying around. It passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23.00 It&amp;#39;s been 33 hours since I took my first Effexor pill, and I just started feeling like myself again. Looking back I don&amp;#39;t even remember much of yesterday other than the times I had bad symptoms, it&amp;#39;s a mix of nausea and anxiety. I&amp;#39;ve decided not to risk taking a second one now, I can&amp;#39;t afford to make myself bed ridden for 2 more days. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll give it a shot over the weekend when I&amp;#39;ll have more free days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I&amp;#39;m terrified of putting myself through this again. Looking back, I think a lot of it was anxiety and panic. Although I have no idea what the 1 AM freak out was about, that was the scariest bit. Also I hope my appetite comes back at some point soon, until then I&amp;#39;ll have to manually remember to eat, which I usually suck at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applaud you if you read all this. If you are here because you&amp;#39;re gonna start Effexor or some other antidepressant please don&amp;#39;t take my word for it. There are just as many success stories out there as there are ones like mine. Everyone reacts differently, and as someone pointed out in my other thread it was probably a shock to my system because for some reason I was prescribed a high dose to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I didn't really know which subreddit to post this in, I just need to open up about this a little bit.

Tommorow, I'm going to attend my first day at a partial hospitalization Program that is 7/8 hours a day. I'm doing this because my therapist believes it will really help me, and I trust her judgement. This will last at least two weeks, or until I feel like I can improve how I feel.

I am diagnosed with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder), GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), and ADHD-C (Hyperactive and Inattentive).

I know deep down that this is the right thing to do, it's just I'm a college student and I have always had high standards for myself regarding academic achievement and not giving up. Doing this program means I am probably withdrawing and costing my parents money for financial aid even though I've only done about a month this semester.

 I really suffered through my first semester with panic attacks, constantly feeling depressed, worthless, self hating etc, daily intrusive thoughts and feelings that would stop me from doing basic things ( like I wouldn't go to the bathroom if someone else was in it), and I could never focus on my work and it really got to me. I secluded myself because I lived on campus and it really took a toll on me.

I also had a few instances of self harm during high school, and had a breakup over a year and a half ago that destroyed me. I lost my best friend who was also my gf at the time, along with the group of friends I saw every day for years that still chill with her. 

I recently relapsed with self harm, and the trigger was news that I got that my ex is dating someone who I know is deep into drugs, a bad student and other things. I feel as though I've gotten over her as a gf, but I still haven't gotten over the loss of a person who I've had the upmost respect for and who I've connected with in every way. I've have not felt this connection (romantically or in a friendship) since.

I keep losing track of my thoughts as I am writing this, so it may sound unorganized and frantic.

I've been on countless medications to try and help me with my anxiety, depression and ADHD, but apparently I'm one of a very low percentage of people who react adversely to medication. These meds have all taken their tolls on my mental health and my hope that things will get better. 

This program that I am going in is stopping me from completing this semester, and school was my only ""job"" and only large responsibility. I feel as though I'm failing myself and my family, and I just want to be like the people who can function and push past their problems. I had no trouble completing high school, and it was very easy for me to pass without much effort and basically no studying. This caused me to have no study skills and I was not prepared for the college workload, especially when I got worse during and after my senior year of high school directly after my breakup.

I again lost my train of thought even though I feel I have so much to write about.

Basically, I'm seeing a therapist weekly, tried tons of different medications, and I'm really trying to be better but I keep letting myself and my family down. 

Also, I smoke weed regularly because it is the only medication that has had long-term beneficial effects on me. Recently, I was caught with product and a piece and charged with two misdemeanors, and this is going to cost my family hundreds of dollars in court fees and I probably will have to complete some program for my sentence. I have stopped smoking because I am afraid of a drug test from the law, and this has caused me to have vivid dreams every night. I used to dream about my ex and times that we used to have, but now the dreams feel like times that haven't happened and I don't feel anything towards her in these dreams. They're just innocent and friendly interactions like when we were just friends. These are taking a toll on me because I remember everything when  I wake up. 

I've also had another really good friend move away last year, and my current best friend was kicked out of his house and lived with us for a while, and just moved out of state two days ago. My other friend just had a child with someone at a young age, so I haven't been able to see him. I have nobody else.

My thoughts are racing again and I cannot focus on what I want to write so I'm going to end this here, I'm basically looking for validation that this program is what I need, and that it's ok that I'm stopping school to focus on myself and my mental health.

,Anxiety,"

I’ve been feeling this way for many years and it’s finally time I said something.  Before I get into it I’d like to preface this with the fact that I am very small and look a lot younger than my actual age , so that could be the actual reason behind things instead of what I’m about talk about, but regardless I need to get this off of my mind...

I’ve felt for a while now that people treat me “differently. “ I’m not sure how to describe it but it’s almost as if they think I can’t do stuff in my own? At least not hard stuff? 

I first noticed it years ago when I attended a summer camp. The camp takes place each summer and you can go multiple years in a row. One of the years you have an opportunity to go on a three day hike, where you take everything you might need with you in a backpack....
The hike is of course accompanied by adults. I noticed a lot of the adults would ask me if I wanted help carrying my backpack. A very nice gesture, however they never seemed to ask any of the other girls if they needed help, it seemed like they thought only I needed the help as if they thought I couldn’t do it on my own

Ever since then I’ve noticed people have treated me differently, as if I can’t do stuff on my own that other people around my age can. I often feel like they think I have a mental disability (which there is nothing wrong with of course) and so feel obligated to help me, and to be honest I do sometimes feel like I have a mental disability and no one told me to “spare my feelings” but that’s for another post...

I also feel... that people don’t take my word seriously? Or at least not as seriously as they would someone else ? I don’t know it’s hard to describe ?  

Things are a bit better at work, where I feel I am taken seriously and trusted to carry out tasks by myself, but there have still been a few times I’ve felt the way I do in the paragraphs above.... or that I’m assigned the  easiest tasks at work while others are assigned more difficult tasks that  “I wouldn’t be able to handle”...

I don’t know maybe I making mountains out of molehills or overthinking things....

,Anxiety,"So for one, I need to find a full time job soon so I can have money to move out of my parent's house and start my life. I'm 24M. 

My girlfriend is 2 hours away. Which sucks. It gives me so much anxiety I want to die. I see her like once a week, sometimes for a few days at a time. We love eachother so much. 

But now that I need to go from a part time job to a full time one, it makes me so stressed. I just want to be with her and not be so far away. I want to have my own place and live closer to her or with her. Just typing this makes me feel so crazy and I'm afraid of being judged. 

How can I not be so anxious and feel so dissasociated? Living without her is so hard. I know I probably need to just save up money until I can afford my own apartment or something. And for my anxiety, I currently take L-Theanine. It doesn't do too much for me though.

Should I try getting on prescription medication? I feel so absolutely crazy and stressed thinking about the future.

,Anxiety,"The more I grow up I’ve been having more perspective about it ,I’ve been used to it that I never noticed it happened . 
My parents would fight all the time ,every morning till everynight on the car rides to even at work infront of people . 
Never knew which side was right or wrong as a child i was always spoiled in a way that wasn’t much but was a lot to me .dad would make sure I’d sleep NECT to him until the age of 15 ,I was tired of being guilted and scared too ,my mom was always pure and genuine and it hurts me to know the things she’s been through .
I was living in the middle of the desert in the midst of my childhood away from everything and everyone ,my only best friend was grand theft auto and my sister would lock me out so she can be in her room . 
I always had a very good relationship with video games and always will 
I never noticed the things my dad said to me growing up ,I never noticed a difference in other family households (I’m so sorry for my grammar and the typing I don’t want to rewrite this )

I never cried much ,I remember the only times I’d cry was as a kid seeing a goat being killed in front of me and the second time I was mono in my later years there . Skinned and bloody and then watching it being slammed over the counter and cut up .
I want to read it out all of this 
I have to .
Growing up I’ve been called everything by my dad 
A fat loser a piece of shit I’m nothing I’m a loser I won’t amount to anyghinb im the reason HES ashamed of bringing me into the world all I do is play video games he wished I wasn’t born how stupid I am .

It was everyday ,being yelled at while fallout 3 was running on my Xbox 360 

He didn’t hit me much but once in a while .i don’t like remembering it .

I wondered in amazement the first time I left my house and spent the night at my friends house.
I got to scared and at 5 in the morning was homesick .my friends never knew I wish I wasn’t .
“Who do you think you are living in someone else’s house eating their food ,sleeping in their bed are you gay?”
Things like that would progress the more I grew older .
The guilt I still go through eats at me, deep enough that it’s long fingers curl over the well where my gut was and wave it’s fingers into the window curtains to the dark brick walls infront of the well under my heart .
I know people lived worse and harsh and even forgettable .
I can’t use my life as an example .
But we all choke no matter how long the rope is .

The more I grew up and strayed from everyone .the more they tried to guilt me for it ,how much of a shitty useless person I am . 

I can’t believe in god ,I genuinely can’t .
I respect others but I can’t .
My sisters husband would lock me in a room to read the Quran till the point where I’d just be mush and somehow past the time .
Being yelled at was all through my life ,
My brother left didn’t see him for about ten year’s 
I don’t like my family not because I don’t respect a part of myself but because I’m tired of a part of who I’m supposed to be . 
I want to rant .
After a while I started to understand my moms point of view all the things he did .
The shame I felt for not knowing as a child and being a actor in someone’s screenplay made my hair attract metal and let it rust ,waiting in the pale moonlight for someone to stomp it back into my skull 
I was as useless an ego boost a man now in his mid 70s .
There’s a lot I can’t go into it 
There’s not a lot that I can’t know 
There’s enough of it that I’m tired 
And enough where I can’t hold .


The self loathing got to me .
The anxiety of being put stripped me of my own right to enjoy life in a sense 
And the fear of being a narcissistic drives me to hate my own tears .

I am too afraid to gain weight used to do about 400 sit ups a day by backs messed up and the bones pinch my nerves . Just things I can’t know I don’t have a good set of true ideas maybe I’m delusional and I can’t know and I’m too stupid and ignorant and I’m always wrong and I don’t need to reassure myself from writing this because if it’s true it’s true and ironically I’m the dumbass .

If you’ve got this far 
I respect you ,maybe you don’t respect yourself or so maybe no one needs respect maybe respect doesn’t matter maybe I just want to say it for I don’t know anything better to say . 
But every poet .writer ,artists criers and listeners relate and express what the other couldn’t fit out for themselves.
All the problems have made a blueprint a snowball of thought that got so big it rolled down the hill and killed some dad who desired to paint a brick wall, 
Some put rocks in their snowballs and hurt everyone in the path .

I know deep down everyone has an ending of trueness and virtue and you all will too .its a tedious battle phases of different tides in motion giving the sailers in your boat motion sickness ,asking for their wives , a moment a fear And more 

It’s very hard to reach it and it’s so easy to understand it and that’s annoying too .
I just know deep down everyone will find what they all have been looking for .
It gets shitty you burn without treating the skin , but you can’t slip as easy ,
The amount makes me sad too 
Knowing and feeling like you’re not good enough for anything 

I think I’ve imagined me killing my father every way possible ,and I mean every way possible 
And still that anger makes me accept a part of him 
And let myself never forgive 
Putting it behind is hard. 
Everything you endure and suffered will show you how low they are deep down 

The inhuman acts of their maintenance of self crumbles in reflecting off themselves 
.
Maybe this one help or maybe it will 
I can’t say much for who am I ?to say so or no ?
A rant made me talk some philosophy that I don’t care to read 

I’m glad you all think individually ,everyone who reads this and doesn’t is deserving of as much love as they can understand and can’t ,
I was filled with pure hatred 
Got stuck in loops 
And it is sad some crave to feel awful over thinks they are not becayse they think they deserve to feel awe 
ful because.

,Anxiety,"Hey, M 19 here. I know it's not healthy to self-diagnose but I was hoping to get some affirmation as to whether what I feel is ""normal"" or if it's a problem. 

I recently discovered that heart palpitations were a thing, and I didn't know that a pounding heartbeat was abnormal. I always feel a tightness in my chest and my heart pounds hard enough that I notice it regularly. 

For as long as I remember, I have bitten away at the skin of my fingers, as well as my nails. I don't have much control over it, and it doesn't happen exclusively when I'm under stress, I just do it subconsciously. I draw blood from my fingers regularly as a result of this, but at this point I'm used to it. 

I am constantly stuck in my thoughts, often to the point of dissociation, but this is something I always attributed to depression. I am fairly certain that I am depressed, although I've never had the motivation to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis. 

Is it normal to feel/do these things? I have lived with all these ""symptoms"" for so long that I've never really considered living life without gnarled fingers, or a racing heartbeat.

,Anxiety,"Social anxiety is the worst. Like I don't care about my appearance and stuff like that. I understand people become friends because of personality and what's on the inside. But I'm just horrible at socializing. When Im in public my social anxiety is fine. Like I won't ever see those random people I just walked next to ever again. I probably won't interact with them in the future. I don't get anxious there. But I get super anxious when I meet with people I do know. Especially at religious meetings. Im so scared because I don't know what to say, talk about or respond when they talk. My social anxiety comes from the fear of people not liking me, or fear of them judging me bc of my personality. when it comes to more cool/confident people. Like I just cant. I don't know how to explain that well.

 

I'm honestly just really scared of letting people down in a way that I'm not interesting or fun to be around. And today was like my last straw. A guy I know (I'm pretty sure either his parents made him or he felt bad for me) invited me over to his house with some other of HIS friends to hang out and play games and stuff. But I was super quiet. I barely said anything. When people were talking to me or when were in group convos I really tried to think of things to respond but when I talk, to me, I just seem like I'm not interested in what they are saying, and that's really the opposite of what I'm trying to do I tried honestly I tried really hard to think of things to say or how I can make a joke of what's going on.

 

But I just couldn't. I felt like crying. I had the chance to redeem myself. Prove these guys I do care what they are saying and prove to them Im a good listener. Prove these guys I could be a potential fun friend. But I just couldn't. I wanted to leave. And if I did try to say something funny or comment I would get ignored sometimes which really hurt me more.

 They probably think I only care about myself. UGHHH ITS SO ANNOYING.

 At the end of November I had a terrible headache, which caused me to panic again and isolate myself from the rest of my friends

It's kind of like that, but what constitutes ""awkward"" is SO broad. It can be literally anything and can happen any time. Even stuff that is not awkward. I maintain a list of these thoughts, and an example of one is when I did a small watercolour of a friend's name for their birthday and how I think I could've done a better job. Below is an example of one that I explained in detail:

I'm watching Neo Tokyo (迷宮物語 - Meikyuu Monogatari). It's a collection of three short films. The second short film involves high intensity futuristic racecar driving. There's a scene where one crashes and explodes in an inferno. As soon as I see it, I am immediately reminded of a time I was getting an uber. The driver was telling me about how one time he was in a tunnel with a passenger, a truck tipped over and exploded. He floored the accelerator to speed out of the tunnel and avoid being stuck in there for hours, and how the passenger gave him a low rating for dangerous driving. He explained his annoyance to me because of how he thought he saved the both of them, but he still received a low rating. At some other point during this trip we were discussing my education history and what I want to do in the future. I told him I majored in Art History even though I knew it doesn't have many job prospects, and instead because I enjoy it. He asked me when I realised this, and I semi-jokingly and semi-seriously said I knew on day one. We both laughed and he told me I was careless. At the time I was laughing just to save face and not really go to deep into an emotional well. As I watched the car explode in the film I remembered all of this instantly; the blazing ball of fire reminding me of what the driver said about the truck in the tunnel, which lead to the education discussion, and eventually my anxiety and distaste around it. Which lead to me saying ""fuck you"" aloud. I'm watching a movie, see a car explode, and say ""fuck you."" All of this happened in about one second.

Perhaps I'm saying ""fuck you"" to the thought itself, like ""fuck off from my brain"", or maybe ""fuck you"" to the uber driver for making me feel like that, even though I know it's nothing???

,Anxiety,"*TW: SUICIDE MENTION*


Hey guys, I've been reading this thread for years, so it's my first time posting. At a bit of a crossroads in life atm and was wondering if there was any advice to keep me going. I graduated nearly 2 years ago (an English with Biology degree) which apart from Creative Writing, I begun to hate because I realised I did it to impress my parents not for myself. Anywho during my time at uni was when I begun to have anxiety during the really stressful times. About my identity and also just feeling genuinely lost because I didn't know what I was gonna do or wanted to do when I left uni. I never really thought about what I wanted for myself before up until. that point. 

I'm now 23. Since graduation I've worked two customer service jobs just because that was all I managed to get interviews for and to help save some money for myself., But the most recent one took my anxiety to a whole new level where I had panic attacks everyday at work and it was affecting my performance. To help, I sought out a therapist. It helped a bit but not enough. I worked there for just under a year but the lack of support there plus other escalations at home led me to having a full nervous breakdown and becoming suicidal. I had to commute to work and every time I was near a train track I could feel the wind pulling me towards em. So I left my job in December because I just knew I could never go back there.

I'm currently on Citalopram, seeing my GP and therapist regularly and have begun the job search again a month ago. I have plans floating in the air about where I want to take my career, but at the moment I'm pretty broke and just trying to get a job. I keep reminding myself everyday that I will get something eventually and it takes time to move on from these things but it's hard, especially when I'm surrounded by age mates going up and up in their careers. I love them and appreciate them, but I can't help but feel jealous. Because I truly feel like I'm starting from the bottom again.

&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I&amp;#39;ve been reading this thread for years, so it&amp;#39;s my first time posting. At a bit of a crossroads in life atm and was wondering if there was any advice to keep me going. I graduated nearly 2 years ago (an English with Biology degree) which apart from Creative Writing, I begun to hate because I realised I did it to impress my parents not for myself. Anywho during my time at uni was when I begun to have anxiety during the really stressful times. About my identity and also just feeling genuinely lost because I didn&amp;#39;t know what I was gonna do or wanted to do when I left uni. I never really thought about what I wanted for myself before up until. that point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now 23. Since graduation I&amp;#39;ve worked two customer service jobs just because that was all I managed to get interviews for and to help save some money for myself., But the most recent one took my anxiety to a whole new level where I had panic attacks everyday at work and it was affecting my performance. To help, I sought out a therapist. It helped a bit but not enough. I worked there for just under a year but the lack of support there plus other escalations at home led me to having a full nervous breakdown and becoming suicidal. I had to commute to work and every time I was near a train track I could feel the wind pulling me towards em. So I left my job in December because I just knew I could never go back there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently on Citalopram, seeing my GP and therapist regularly and have begun the job search again a month ago. I have plans floating in the air about where I want to take my career, but at the moment I&amp;#39;m pretty broke and just trying to get a job. I keep reminding myself everyday that I will get something eventually and it takes time to move on from these things but it&amp;#39;s hard, especially when I&amp;#39;m surrounded by age mates going up and up in their careers. I love them and appreciate them, but I can&amp;#39;t help but feel jealous. Because I truly feel like I&amp;#39;m starting from the bottom again. I have a passion for writing and even have a blog that I post to but again, most jobs I apply for related to that field haven&amp;#39;t really given me a chance. Just some words of encouragement if anyone has them. Affirmations would be good too, I&amp;#39;m tryna create some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate your thoughts people.&lt;/p&gt;

It feels as if I can't take deep enough breaths, don't get satisfied when breathing. I do get a satisfying breath every once in awhile, but then it goes back to feeling like I'm suffocating.
I also have pain in my heart sometimes, palpitations and pressure on my chest.

I've done a bunch of tests, all of which are ""normal"" (ECG, Spirometry, chest X-ray, CRP blood test and so on...)

I'm able to workout at the gym but the breathlessness gets worse.
I have a friend that has anxiety and both him and my doctors say it's anxiety causing it.
The thing is that I don't really feel anxious at all. I'm not hyperventilating or anything, but the breathlessness is always there annoying the fuck out of me. I can't take it any longer!!!

,Anxiety,"Everytime my family comes for a visit, it's always filled with drama and misunderstanding. Every visit. My mother comes and starts imposing herself and bringing drama. It's always the same. It always leaves me feeling spent and all around confused. Every visit is filled with drama. I get sick of constantly being told how to live my life, and being not given gifts but forced to take things I didnt ask for. And she'll happily use dire situations as an excuse to do exactly what no amount of honest, fhisnis stressing me communication would make her otherwise stop. She has good intentions, but takes a lot of things too far. And uses her good intentions to mask the dysfunction in our relationship. And when I get stressed out, she immediately tries to get a sympathetic response out of me, when I am trying to cope with my anxiety. 

As soon as she arrives, she just keeps knocking non stop at the door. If I cant immediately get to it, let's say I'm in the bathroom, I'd need to text her that, otherwise she will keep on knocking every two to three seconds. And then when I open the door, all the drama starts again. Years of issues I want to talk about, brushed under the rug. And I end up getting this impulse to try and please her and prove to her that I can take care of myself, since she does everything in her power to reduce my responsibilities, even if I want to have them. She doesn't treat her children like adults, and tries to continue to perform the role she would need to perform for younger children. Rather than letting me come and ask, may I borrow this, or can I have this bread or some leftovers, she just brings bag after bag of groceries for me. 

While most of you will probably be thinking, but that's really sweet, please take a moment to not overshadow your experience over mine. Bringing a gift occasionally is fine. There is nothing wrong with bringing some cookies or something that she baked every now and then. There is nothing wrong with bringing some stuff you find handy or in the case of foodm you enjoy eating, and offering it. Offering, with only one repetition of are you sure? And that's it. No forcing me to take it or trying to guilt trip and manipulate for your own satisfaction. While paying bills isnt by any measure easy, I enjoy going to to grocery store and buying my own groceries. Out of my own money. I enjoy opening up the fridge and seeing products I bought for myself in there. I don't have a problem with the occasional gift. I would rather that I come to my parents for help when I need it, than they constantly assume things and bring me bag loads of things I didnt ask for that they dont offer but force me to keep and use. 

Good intentions have their limits. This is something I have explained to her as many times as you open a door or close one inside a whole day. And every time she says I understand. And then does the same again. The coronavirus outbreak is certainly bad, and a lot worse than what the news portrays, but it isnt the rapture. It's not the apocalypse. Whenever she comes now, it is a long drama filled lecture about how the virus is going to shut down the city. And bold suggestions like you need to break your lease, so you can come live with us during this time until the outbreak is over. Again, while I'm not the kind of person to say that it couldn't spread to where they start big time quarantining, I'm not going to make the preemptive jump to assume that my city atlanta is going to turn into wuhan 2.0. And passively making bold, emotionally heavy statements like that is taxing to those that have their emotions invested in you. Especially since I busted my ass for this apartment, and had to save up almost in secrecy, because if I didn't, she would do everything in her power to prevent me from attaining it by trying to convince me everyday not to move out. And when I did, she started saying that I need to break my lease, which would cost me like 2000 dollars, because living there would cause our insurance to go up, even though it is already bound to increase when I turn 25. 

Ever since I moved out, every visit has just been filled with drama regarding my living here. I cant take it anymore. I'm sick of all this. So maybe she's right. Maybe the outbreak will have these grand effects, that doesn't change the fact that you're telling me for the second time, to break my fucking lease. And always pushing me against the situational wall with something. It isnt the coronavirus. She has a shitload of anxiety and doesn't know how to handle it. Most of it revolves around her children. Even if there was no outbreak, it would be something else. If it's not this,it's that. As much as I love her, and believe me I do.

,Anxiety,"Through the end of 2018 (October) to all the way through 2019. I struggled with major anxiety. I was diagnosed with GAD in January 2019. It was a tough year. It gets better. It became easier to cope with as time went on.

I was prescribed medication to numb the physical symptoms of the anxiety like shaking, sweating, and the tightning of the stomach. It didn't always work but it was at the time better than the alternative. The side effects of the medication made me feel weak and dizzy. 

Throughout the year, I missed out on school which really screwed me up. I failed classes, got bumped down below the rest of the class and even got kicked out of some classes. When I was in school, I was an easy target for bullies. I spent that whole year just letting them walk all over me. I was defenceless. Ignoring them didn't make a difference. 

I was ugly and ashamed of my looks. I wanted to change that but I didn't have the will power.

I started researching on how to get rid of it. I tried so many things, like quiting cafiene, high salt foods and sweets. But nothing seemed to work.

One day in November, I called up my friend and asked him if he wanted to go for a walk and he said yes. This was a life changing moment for me. For starters, I opened up to him about my anxiety and my insecurities and we talked it out. Through venting my feelings out, I felt better and more confident. In return he vented about his problems and I listened. Talking to someone really helped and I'm ashamed that it took me that long to open up.

I wanted to look better and beat my anxiety, thankfully exercising is great at doing both. I started jogging, and doing push ups ans sit ups. I then convinced myself to go out alone, which I was very afraid to do. Walking alone felt horrible at first but it began to feel very freeing. I had bags under my eyes, I needed more sleep. Thankfully sleep is good for both your eyes and alleviating anxiety. I composed a sleep schedule for myself. Out at 9pm, wake up at 7 am for school. This was a darastic change that helped me a lot.

When the new year hit, my resolution was to beat my anxiety, then my journey begun. The year started off horrible with fears of a possible world war 3 which sent me back. I couldn't function while thinking about the impending doom but then one day it all disappeared and that was that. I don't know why it stopped as I try to stay away from politics but I'm thankful that it did. 

On the 13th January 2020, I quit my medication. I figured that the only real way to get over this was to dive right into hell. The first day was rough, the second was better and the third was normal. It was the first time that I had felt normal in over a year.

I think the cause of my anxiety was my lack of motivation. I didn't exercise, didnt go outside, didn't sleep and I ate like crap. I'm pretty sure that my lack of social experience caused my fear of it. Throughout January and February, I spent the months throwing myself into painful scenarios, exercising more, going out more and sleeping more. The painful scenarios got me use to social contact and how to overcome specific scenarios. I was nervous as hell and I still am but I learned to fake confidence and it worked.

I was no longer afraid of going to school, or going out alone. I feel better. I'm not cured but I'm in a better place. I have worked to destroy my insecurities by working on them.

,Anxiety,"Hi. I’ve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn’t spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn’t until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they’re retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn’t relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had “other groups” of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they’d be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I’m an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I’ll be home for 3-4 days straight, can’t bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple “socialization for the day.” I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can’t bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don’t understand what’s going on with me, it’s like I’ve reached such a level of being a slob that I can’t bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won’t get back (though let’s be real, I won’t be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

 •I go to the bathroom and when I come back to my dorm I'll decide to take my shoes off. While taking my shoes off, one shoe sits on top of the laces. I get that feeling of chills

•when I sit in some classes, my long coat hangs on the floor and gets dust/dirt on it. Sometimes I only feel annoyed but sometimes I get that feeling.

,Anxiety,"Hey everyone. I just to write this and get it off my mind.

I'm a 26 year old male who has recently come to realization that I will never have kids. This is something I have always wanted for myself ever since I was a child but I know it will not happen for me. I'm this swirling mess of anxiety and depression lately because of it but for now I think I'm able to cope.

I am an asexual person without any drive to have a relationship with either men or women. I've never once desired to be in a relationship of any kind except one where I had a child. I guess I always pictured having one with a friend when I think about it. Unfortunately all of my friends are now in relationships and are having kids of their own. It makes me feel left behind even though I know 26 isn't particularly old. My best friend and sister is due and April and I alternate between overwhelming love and seething jealousy which makes me feel crazy.

I also come from a poor family. Being Canadian I know that poor is a relative term but I grew up with with two siblings and a single father in a house with one bedroom and one bathroom. Our power was always shaky, we didn't have a computer or phones or enough food for school lunches. To help out I started working early and paid my own fees for school. I even paid for a school trip to Japan to treat myself. I am the first university graduate in my family. However I still make the least of all my family (my siblings and my dad). I'm the only one who went to school and I have 70000$ of debt and a job that is worse than my siblings... I can't afford surrogacy and adoption is hard when you are alone and trying to prove you can care for a child. I make enough to raise a child in my area plus I have a lot of support. However I am told I should be working my student debt off first. It's a very slow process.

These things tell me and apparently other people that currently I am not fit to raise a child. Or not ready. It's very hard for me to hear not worthy although I manage to get those feelings to pass quite quickly. My friends and family brush off my concerns saying that it'll happen for me eventually and that everything will work out but it's for them to get past the conversation without feeling awkward. Sometimes I need someone just to be real with me and acknowledge that it just doesn't happen for everyone.

My anxiety about myself, my worth, even the thought of being alone can feel crippling from time to time. I have these panic attacks that keep me up at night. Addiction and negative interactions with medication run in my family so I have a certain level of mistrust in them. I have a referral for psychiatry but unfortunately the wait is 2 years. I go through cycles of feeling normal and then back to being in my head. Knowing others have it harder makes me feel guilty and ashamed. I'm jealous of women I see. I have serious womb envy. I would just go ""do it"" myself if I could. But I also know that not every woman can have children and that cross to bear is probably way heavier than mine. This also makes me feel guilty.

There are many other factors that swirl in my head but I think I've written enough for now.

I have so much love to give and that doesn't seem to be enough.

,Anxiety,"This is a pretty unstructured rant about video games and mental health. It is a fairly long post

I have been playing video games since I was 4. My dad got an original PlayStation and I would watch him play and then play. From the get go, we had quite a few games and I remember playing PS1 Demos from magazines, so many different games like an overload of choice already from a young age like porn is. I loved it. I was/am extremely shy and introverted, but I loved video games, as well as other things at the time like toys, my close family, TV. 

Family fell apart when father left, sister went off the rails was kicked out, so was just me and my mother who is emotionally unstable and though loved me, never expressed it well or enough. I loved my Dad but would only seem him ones every two weeks.

I still loved video games, I gained pure enjoyment and challenges out of them, this carried on until ages 14 when I found more ‘hardcore’ games like world of warcraft, the MMO’s, COD4 etc. Life got more challenging as it does but I kept gaming (still loving them) but I kept on being introverted, shy, socially anxious etc.

I dropped out of life after high school (16). I still made attempts and did things, but slowly I fell back to my comfort zone and I spent more time in it.

From the ages of 16-26 I would say I have done almost nothing but live in my bedroom distracting myself with YouTube, games, porn, weed etc.

I have made some attempts and I’m proud of a few things. I quit a weed habit that lasted 4 years, I was stoned from the moment I woke up to bed in my own hazy world. I also smoked cigarette for 6 years. I quit them both 4 years ago and have no intention/want to go back to those.

More recently I’ve quit porn. I’ve watched porn daily since ages 13 – 26. I’m 45 days in without looking at it, honestly, I’m not sure if it’s a problem or not, but it’s a challenge I’m doing to see if it has some benefits. 

Back to gaming. Video games are so ingrained in me that it’s almost a part of me. So much nostalgia, memories, good times, hours of life are from video games. So many stories, so much good music, challenges, frustration, journeys, disappointment. 

Recently video games have become a burden and curse, a job. A requirement, a commitment. And I’m talking about single-player games, of all genres, of all systems. I put down the MMO’s and games I was heavily addicted to that were just endless. I am glad about that.

I feel immense guilt if I sit down and play a video game now. I don’t get that with YouTube, tv, or just wasting time in any other way. I feel guilt that I am escaping reality. I can immersive myself in a game for weeks and be happy, and it ends or I beat it and I feel like I was dead the whole time. Completely wasted, empty feeling. So much effort, attention, time into something that when I turn the screen off is gone.

I also have made gaming a chore and work. There are 100’s of games I want to play, I get a dopamine rush starting a new game, enjoy it and slowly my mind starts to say “hurry up, there are loads of games to get through”. I start thinking of the games I’ve left unfinished from years ago and quit the game I’m playing now, go back to the unfinished one with a sense of urgency, that I NEED to complete it or I’m missing out on the story or I will leave it so much longer I’ll forget the story. (seems like anxiety rooted problem)

I am diagnosed with Avoidant Personality Disorder, depression and probably have some minor autistic traits specific to socialising and the way I think. I do no socialise unless with 2 family members, I have only worked 6 months and I’m 26. I’m not proud of it. I have issues but also have dug myself into a hole and have given up. I do accept responsibility regardless of mental health issues.

I have taken many antidepressants, probably 11+ along with therapy over the course of 10 years but at best maybe 1 of them worked  very slightly but I still stayed in the cycle I am in, or got off them because I convinced myself they were cheating, going to poison my brain in years to come, etc. Or that I was better and did not need them

 I feel like I should delete the 100’s of games and ROMsI have on my HDD. I have about 5 TB worth of games that I ‘want’ to play and 100’s of SNES, GBA, PS1, Genesis, DS, 3DS etc games on my phone/computer/handhelds.
 I’ve sold my PS4 pro I just bought 2 days ago because I feel guilt. I feel guilty about the hours of escape that I want to indulge in and comfort. I feel the sensible thing to do is send it back, and yet I feel I am missing out yet I DON’T EVEN HAVE A JOB/FRIEND/FAMILY. Why am I placing such important over the PS4 pro.

Maybe this is a healthy response, maybe it a realisation that I am going nowhere fast and prioritize games over life. Just the way gaming has become for me makes me sad. How it provided so much joy but is now giving me guilt or could even be the source of many of my problems all along. Or maybe I just need a life, and I can go back to gaming. I have no idea.

For not I am saying no to all gaming. And yet I will just sit on YouTube instead. It is getting to the point where the perceived stress is going to make me go insane either giving myself more mental health issues or suicide. Or just caving in and continuing for more years until reality hits and I’m forced to give it up.",t2_3lx854lg,False,,0,False,Mental health situation and relationship with video games,[],r/Anxiety,False,1,healthflair,0,,False,t3_fcbaba,False,dark,,public,4,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Health,False,4,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1583180650.0,text,1,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty unstructured rant about video games and mental health.

&lt;p&gt;Recently video games have become a burden and curse, a job. A requirement, a commitment. And I’m talking about single-player games, of all genres, of all systems. I put down the MMO’s and games I was heavily addicted to that were just endless. I am glad about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel immense guilt if I sit down and play a video game now. I don’t get that with YouTube, tv, or just wasting time in any other way. I feel guilt that I am escaping reality. I can immersive myself in a game for weeks and be happy, and it ends or I beat it and I feel like I was dead the whole time. Completely wasted, empty feeling. So much effort, attention, time into something that when I turn the screen off is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have made gaming a chore and work. There are 100’s of games I want to play, I get a dopamine rush starting a new game, enjoy it and slowly my mind starts to say “hurry up, there are loads of games to get through”. I start thinking of the games I’ve left unfinished from years ago and quit the game I’m playing now, go back to the unfinished one with a sense of urgency, that I NEED to complete it or I’m missing out on the story or I will leave it so much longer I’ll forget the story. (seems like anxiety rooted problem)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am diagnosed with Avoidant Personality Disorder, depression and probably have some minor autistic traits specific to socialising and the way I think. I do no socialise unless with 2 family members, I have only worked 6 months and I’m 26. I’m not proud of it. I have issues but also have dug myself into a hole and have given up. I do accept responsibility regardless of mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have taken many antidepressants, probably 11+ along with therapy over the course of 10 years but at best maybe 1 of them worked  very slightly but I still stayed in the cycle I am in, or got off them because I convinced myself they were cheating, going to poison my brain in years to come, etc. Or that I was better and did not need them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should delete the 100’s of games and ROMsI have on my HDD. I have about 5 TB worth of games that I ‘want’ to play and 100’s of SNES, GBA, PS1, Genesis, DS, 3DS etc games on my phone/computer/handhelds.
 I’ve sold my PS4 pro I just bought 2 days ago because I feel guilt. I feel guilty about the hours of escape that I want to indulge in and comfort. I feel the sensible thing to do is send it back, and yet I feel I am missing out yet I DON’T EVEN HAVE A JOB/FRIEND/FAMILY. Why am I placing such important over the PS4 pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is a healthy response, maybe it a realisation that I am going nowhere fast and prioritize games over life. Just the way gaming has become for me makes me sad. How it provided so much joy but is now giving me guilt or could even be the source of many of my problems all along. Or maybe I just need a life, and I can go back to gaming. I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For not I am saying no to all gaming. And yet I will just sit on YouTube instead. It is getting to the point where the perceived stress is going to make me go insane either giving myself more mental health issues or suicide. Or just caving in and continuing for more years until reality hits and I’m forced to give it up.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Disclaimer:  This worked for me, but may not be the best choice for you.  If medication isn't the best choice for you, that's no problem!  You do what's best for you, and I recommend a discussion with your healthcare providers.

I was diagnosed with GAD and OCD about 8 years ago in grad school, and I would fall into funks that I called ""time loops"" where I was on an infinite cycle of ritual completion and suffer from random panic attacks in highly inconvenient locations.  At the time, I was scared that medications would interfere with my ability to think or that I would become a zombie and be unable to be effective at school, so I did talk therapy and noticed a pretty big improvement in how I was doing.  I was in talk therapy off and on for several years, but the effectiveness was starting to become more limited as time went by.

Flash forward a few years after graduation and my anxiety came back in full force with a new set of highly inconvenient and occasionally embarrassing symptoms.  At the beginning of the year at it's peak, I had a complete meltdown and a panic attack that lasted for basically an entire night, didn't sleep at all, and I was pretty much a wreck the entire next day.  I figured it was probably time to change up how I was managing things because talk therapy alone just wasn't working.  I couldn't get an appointment that day, so the next morning I went off to see a GP to get a basic prescription for an SSRI and a referral.

I was prescribed a basic medication for anxiety with the instruction that things should start getting better after 4-6 weeks.  At the time, I felt resigned to the idea that ""I guess I just can't manage this by myself"" and it was hard to get over the idea that I was broken somehow for needing meds.

Within about 2 weeks I started feeling better.  I didn't feel perfect, but I was in a better mental state than I had been.  I didn't have crazy side effects, and I didn't turn into a zombie.  After about a month, I felt like an entirely new person.  I would go to anxiety triggering events and locations and think ""I am going to have a panic attack here like I always do"" and then I just wouldn't have one.  I expected to have anxiety symptoms and start to lose my shit, but I never did.  I went though the trigger events and went on my way.

In summary, the initial appointment discussing my symptoms was easy and wasn't as terrifying as I thought.  I followed up with a psychiatrist to discuss how things were going, and that was also easy and straightforward.  I started feeling better much earlier than the 4 weeks they quoted, and I don't feel like I'm drugged up or dulled - I feel like a calmer and more confident version of myself.

&lt;p&gt;I was prescribed a basic medication for anxiety with the instruction that things should start getting better after 4-6 weeks.  At the time, I felt resigned to the idea that &amp;quot;I guess I just can&amp;#39;t manage this by myself&amp;quot; and it was hard to get over the idea that I was broken somehow for needing meds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within about 2 weeks I started feeling better.  I didn&amp;#39;t feel perfect, but I was in a better mental state than I had been.  I didn&amp;#39;t have crazy side effects, and I didn&amp;#39;t turn into a zombie.  After about a month, I felt like an entirely new person.  I would go to anxiety triggering events and locations and think &amp;quot;I am going to have a panic attack here like I always do&amp;quot; and then I just wouldn&amp;#39;t have one.  I expected to have anxiety symptoms and start to lose my shit, but I never did.  I went though the trigger events and went on my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the initial appointment discussing my symptoms was easy and wasn&amp;#39;t as terrifying as I thought.  I followed up with a psychiatrist to discuss how things were going, and that was also easy and straightforward.  I started feeling better much earlier than the 4 weeks they quoted, and I don&amp;#39;t feel like I&amp;#39;m drugged up or dulled - I feel like a calmer and more confident version of myself.  I wish I had started medications years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"How do you deal with it? I have always been an anxious kid but I've never had the debilitating, panic-attack inducing anxiety I have now.

My therapist helped me unpack it and I think its a lot to do with my overachiever parents with high expectations.

When I was young, I was definitely an over-scheduled kid, so part of it was I didn't have time to get panic attacks because my mind was always busy. Also, another thing was I was basically taught as a child that if I have free time, that means I'm not trying hard enough, and with most office-jobs... you have a lot of free time.

Another part of it is the fact that when you're in school, you know how well you're doing. They give you a score that literally determines how ""good"" you are. We don't have report cards for work, yes you have annual reviews but that doesn't mean anything when everyone always gets a ""keep up the good work!""

And finally, the workplace politics. OMG I have no idea how to manage it. Most of my anxiety in high school was related to high school drama, so this makes sense to me. I worry way too much about how I'm perceived. I'm people pleasing to a fault, and venting about how overwhelmed I am by certain people is only a temporary fix. Its usually followed up by how paranoid I am that the team/people I complain about will know I dislike them. (which is nuts because I don't even gossip, just complain to my manager/ team who I trust).

I'm also a manager, which like how? How did they trust me with people managing? I constantly fear that my own team hates me even though I've gotten nothing but glowing reviews. But also, why would your subordinates tell you that they dislike you?

,Anxiety,"I’ve been in therapy before plenty. And am currently in therapy. And it is helpful to a degree. But no matter the therapy, I find myself slipping back into this pattern of feeling wronged, but feeling like I can’t really express myself or get my point across right. So then it comes out wrong or I just fail at it completely, and still feel wronged but find myself apologizing instead.

And it’s just the self sabotaging loop of never feeling like I can truly stand up for myself. Because I’m always nervous that I’ll just be “that bitch” or annoy someone or push someone away.

My therapist says it’s cause I made a version of myself that said you’re unlovable, you’ll always fail, you’ll never get close to people... because I grew up with a pretty emotionally manipulative family. Especially my mother, who I lived with til I was 15 and could take no more.

I’m so tired of feeling misunderstood, or not even fully understanding myself.

,Anxiety,"I read a Harvard study recently stating that exercise can help reduce anxiety. I've lead a pretty sedentary life, and only in my 30's have I attempted to be more active. I didn't go full force on it because when started trying my body became severely inflamed. Long story short, I had enlarged tonsils and sensitivity to gluten. I got my tonsils removed and stopped eating gluten and it's helped a lot, at least with inflammation. I've been able to take on a lot more exercise than I used to.. and it has helped but I'm wondering can it totally combat anxiety? If so, how much exercise is really needed? Is the tradeoff for feeling high anxiety and mental fatigue.. constant physical fatigue? If I haven't fully fatigued myself to the point my body aches the next day I don't really find that I have a ton of payoff anxiety wise, even though I know it's good for me, regardless. So of course I'm going to keep on working out consistently.

I'm not complaining about the tradeoff, just curious if anyone can chime in with their own experience and thoughts on the matter. I find that I really do enjoy working out, but there are times I over-do it and am excessively cranky the following days and also have to sleep so much more than normal to recover.

,Anxiety,"Hi friends,

first time posting so I'm a tad nervous so I'm sorry. 

For the past week I've been struggling to sleep all the way through the night. Waking up every 1-3 hours with what feels like an anxiety attack. I feel ok for the first couple seconds of being awake but then think to myself ""What time is it? oh crap I did it again"" and it spirals out of control from there. I've been missing work due to the lack of sleep and feeling like I can't function. It's like a vicious cycle of either constant worry or exhaustion. 

Previous to this I was going in to work every day but would get so anxious that I'd have to excuse myself to go dry heave in the bathroom or step outside for fresh air. I'm just really scared that this will never go away which only makes everything worse.

&amp;#x200B;

My question(s) about medication is that last week a psychiatrist prescribed me Citalopram 20mgs (Which I've been taking every day as directed) and Hydroxyzine (10mgs), to anyone who takes Hydroxyzine may I ask, do you feel the  need to take it every few hours? I take it and I feel okay for a little bit but then the worry starts to creep back in and I feel like I need it again, but then I start to worry about being dependent on it and not being able to live without it. 

Can anyone offer some advice around any of this? Sorry for the rambling I'm just trying really hard to cope and not panic with the constant feeling of anxiety.

,Anxiety,"hello everyone. first time poster. thank you for taking me with open arms. i have been making extremely meaningful changes in my life over the last 3 years and about to shake everything so massively that i am aghast and confused and horrified and really really nervous about the next big change i signed up for: i am moving out of a dream apartment into a cool seeming house with 5 people after living by myself for 10 years.

what i am giving up: for the last 3 years I have lived in a very beautiful apartment in san francisco. its utterly beautiful. its a cottage-feeling kind of tiny 1br, you can see the moon from my bed, views out of every window. so sunny (almost unbearably so.) its clean and quiet. am laughing/truly angry with myself now that i have decided to leave thinking of the things that annoyed me about it bc i am in shock i am giving it up. i am at the cusp of regret. 

On the other hand: living here alone has been hard on myself. for better or for worse i have been able to afford rent alone because i had a well paying job and some help from my parents. i lived alone, as i have for the last 10 years. im 35 and haven't been in a relationship much longer than 6 months and living alone -- while recently working from home -- has made me feel withdrawn, paranoid, lonsome, needy, sad, depressed. i've grown more distant from my family (healthy) and have many good friends across the country (i'm from the east coast and many are still there) but being trapped in this small apartment with such little space to grow or interact in the ways i was craving was exploiding something inside of me.

so i am leaving this ""perfect"" place to join a mansion with a lot of character with 6 people who seem nice. i have my own bedroom and an OK office and a shared workspace and a shared indoor patio and TV room. 

My soul loved this idea from the first time i heard about it by text. i liked it and the people when i saw it. i am/was excited about the new neighborhood. i am/was excited for a new beginning. i was tired of begging for change so i stirred the pot myself. 

the anxiety came in bad today. i brought some crystals and good vibe type things to break in the room and was disapointed by how much smaller it looked. it wasn't as clean as i pictured and badly needed new paint. 

im meeting the landlords tomorrow and will request a new shade that i like and hope for the best. some of my friends (including a guy i think i am locked in too needy/too close of a pattern with that might be holding me back from others maybe? i dont know?) think its a bad idea that im moving and is sad too and isn't as able to be as supportive as i hoped. my mom is actively against the idea and have actively tried to prusuade against me doing this so no support there either.

I have wishes that moving will make some of my problems go away and my anxiety is rising knowing of course thats not true. i feel so fragile. so delicate, full of hope, full of fear. 

thanks for the solidarity or any words of support you have. i'd like to think making this move is a clearing of my roots. it may not be comfortable but its an important clearing. i hope and wish and maybe sense that its part of a series of actions nessisary for an important part of my destiny.

The day before I felt so anxious that I started to get massive headaches and cold sweats, then the morning after I just wanted to puked cause I was so fucking nervous for the interview. After settling down but still anxious I went out and had breakfast before the interview. Once I got into the office I didn't know who to reach to until one of the staff approached me and asked do I need help. I told that I had an appointment for an interview and they were kind enough to guide me to a room where I needed to do an aptitude test.

I was frustrated and nervous that I couldn't even do the arithmetic questions on it, until the interviewer came in and asked me a bunch of questions. I tried my hardest to answer his questions without pausing too much and whether or not I'm proficient at excel to which I responded with ""I only know the basics"", until he finally asked me ""what is your end goal?"" I couldn't give him a proper answer.

He then said that I looked lost and can't find a sense of direction, to which I fully agreed with him. I told him this was my first time actually going for an actual interview from a company. He then asked me whether or not am I fit to join this company to which I answered honestly with ""I felt that I don't have the charisma nor the interpersonal skills to be here."" He then gave me a bunch of advice about finding out what your end goal is and improve my communication skills.

I then thanked him and said those were very helpful advice and will try to improve myself. I then went home and was calm for about 30 seconds until I broke down and cried my eyes out, cause I know and fully admitted to myself that I am lost. I have no sense of directions and I have no proper human skills and started laughing and crying at the same time. As of right now I burning through my 4th cigarette whiile bawling my eyes out and laughing.

I have an interview tomorrow as well, and I just hope this one goes well. I just need some practice but I have really bad anxiety and suck at almost everything.

You feel like you are never good enough. When someone else gets what you want, when you have tried so hard to achieve it you just feel crushed. You feel like being an anxious person is just holding you back. It’s not fair but, you have to keep going. You must! You feel a knot in your stomach, and you feel frozen. You want to give up but, then the anxiety causes you to keep going. You want to rise to the top. You want to be a fighter and make others proud.

,Anxiety,"Sorry if this is a bit mismatched, I'm typing as I think. I just want to get as much of my thoughts in one place as possible.

I've worked myself up into a frenzy over thinking I have liver failure from drinking. The news around coronovirus and general uni stress aren't helping either. I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, and I've always been a hypochondriac. In the past ive been convinced I had various cancers, IBS, appendicitis and heart disease, among other things. 

Long story short after starting uni in september I went from drinking zero to too much (really started in November). I'm not an alcoholic; I just had an unhealthy habit. This has been an issue before with unhealthy food &amp; energy drinks, which were actually much more difficult to give up; it was definitely too much of a good thing. I'm a bit annoyed I didn't see it coming really given my past excesses. I guess being surrounded by people who do drink lots subconsciously reinforces it as acceptable... My parents are very anti alcohol and as such I was brought up that way, I'd also be devastated to dissappoint them. I also think I kind of felt free once I moved to uni so went a bit over the top.

 Once I started I found I never really liked mad binge drinking (though I did get drunk a good few times). I mostly just drank casually with flatmates (never alone). In January though I had a bit of a crazy week and went out 3 times. I felt like shit at the end, and it was a bit of a wake up call. It made me realise the damage it could do without just laughing it off, and I genuinely believed I was going to die of liver failure. For context I should add I'm physically very fit, which puts me in a slightly better position from the get-go.

From that I decided to stop (which hasn't been a problem at all, I don't feel the need to drink or get withdrawal). Two weeks later I had a couple drinks for a special occasion (planned ahead; wasn't on a whim) and was very careful. A week later (today) and I've got huge anxiety over the damage I could have done. I genuinely believe I'm experiencing liver failure, even if most of the ""symptoms"" I'm experiencing are tenuous at best (even if I don't believe it). I had a panic attack and my heart has been racing since, currently lying in bed at 85bpm when my resting is 50 odd 😬.

I keep checking my skin and eyes in the mirror, I keep prodding my stomach to check for pains. Ive also become hyper aware of my body so any tiny pain that I otherwise wouldn't feel makes me think it's my liver and I'm going to die.  My stomach is churning because of the whole fight / flight thing, which only reinforces it...

I think the biggest issue is that I have started to become bothersome and annoying to people that are close to me. I’m hyper aware of slight atmospheric or emotional fluctuations, and I usually have very visceral reactions to any amount of emotional potency or pain.

And my anxiety is making my chances of ever being with her so bad.

**I have anxiety.**

I think the root is anxiety, because I'm constantly avoiding tasks and ultimately, life, for one of three reasons:

1. Fear of failure originating from perfectionism. This is worsened by analysis paralysis due to indecision.

\-A way to assure failure is by not even making an attempt. Failure might happen even with an attempt and that is OK. It is both scary and freeing to realize this is the case.

2. Outright laziness initially triggered by fatigue from being underslept and helped along by point 1. An additional aspect is laziness due to being so far gone (in a task, hour, night, as well as behind on responsibilities) that I might as well continue to be lazy. This in turn exacerbates the anxiety because I fall further and further behind.

\-While in laziness-induced condition, I sometimes give the false impression to myself that I am actually making progress on a task/planning through internet research. Analysis paralysis exacerbates this because it makes me compelled to read pages and pages of results when I already know the conclusions/next steps.

\-False impressions extend to others. I give the outward appearance that I've made progress on a task or at least started it although I am sometimes lying about this, which just makes it easier to do again. This strategy falls apart when the time to actually be accountable comes.

3. This technique, while flawed, has worked numerous times in the past. I have conditioned myself to this lower level of output. When a true externally enforced deadline is in place, I am able to get some version of the task done and the outward appearance is that I did so and that is ultimately on what I judge success.

&amp;#x200B;

\*It's simple to say but I really believe the best way to break this cycle is to realize it is happening and just get started even a little bit at a time.

So I was taking my daily commute to school yesterday. My anxiety has been really bad lately especially while driving. I'm on the highway, no problem. Things are going smooth besides the raging anxious thoughts in my mind. The traffic is thick so we all come to a stop. I sit there, eyeing the cars in front of me, around me, thinking about tackling my day and then... All of a sudden I hear tires screech and then... BOOM! My car jolts forward and I am slightly stunned. A wave of anxiety rushes over me and I feel... helpless. Immediately I start shaking, hyperventilating, I'm on the verge of tears and I see the driver behind me come out of his car and ask me if I'm okay. I had 911 on the phone but I hung up because I saw the back of my car was relatively okay. I was so shaken up and not thinking clearly plus I've never been in an accident before where I was behind the wheel. I didn't take any of his information. I wasn't thinking at all. We both parted ways because I was so anxious and afraid and I didn't want my insurance to go up because I'm young and I didn't even do anything wrong! I'm not sure if this is true, but my mom always told me that sometimes even if you are not at fault your insurance will still go up.

&amp;#x200B;

Now part of me keeps thinking about it. Sometimes I'm angry because I think he might've been texting while driving and honestly part of me wishes his insurance went up so he would learn his lesson!!!  There are tiny scratches and 2 holes on my bumper but my car is old to begin with and it had marks on the back when I purchased it but every time I look at those new blemishes it reminds me of the incident. Every time I get behind the wheel I think about it.... The impact, the noise, the feeling... It just won't go away. It's eating my up inside. I feel so stupid though for not taking any info, but I just was so anxious and in shock. I wanted it all to be over.

,Anxiety,"Ok so no matter where i go, bus station, grocery store, out for a walk, gas station, downtown people always seem to stare at me. I am very aware of my sorroundings and can feel when im being watched or someone is staring at me. Sure enough 90% of the time i feel someone staring at me and i quickly look at them and they are! Alot of times ill stare at them and they wont even look away. I have to give them a serial killer look just to make them stop looking at me and sometimes that doesnt work.

I am 5ft6
Lightskinned (Half black/Half white)
Male
I always wear dark colors
I wear black hoodies and beanies alot
I have big black eyes
I have dark facial hair
I often get mistaken for being indian and sometimes mexican

I feel i look like a normal person. Not super attractive but not ugly either but rather average. I look at myself in the mirror and cant find anything abnormal about my appearance itself that causes people to stare. I get stares from all genders. Men, Teenagers, Women, Kids even babies! I cant go a single place without going through this issue. Ill even be in the bathroom using the urinal and the dude next to me will look at me. I understand its human nature to look at people but im talking about people who just flat out stare in a obnoxious way. Its very rude and i dont understand why they do it. Its gotten so bad to the point i have almost gotten into confrontations and fights. Im just fed up with it. I am not attractive enough for half a room to look at me but im not ugly either. Atleast i dont think so. I just dont know what is wrong with me. Ill admit some looks can be good and bad ive noticed. Sometimes females will look at me and smile or glance. When i know someone is staring at me with good intentions such as they think i look friendly and want to be my friend or think im attractive then i dont mind but when someone is looking at me with a smirk on their face or weird look or even laughing while looking at me it makes me mad and i want to know why their doing that asap and wont stop until i can establish control over the situation.",t2_5qzl027s,False,,0,False,People always stare at me and its not in my head?,[],r/Anxiety,False,1,,0,,False,t3_femoya,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,1583539774.0,,[],{},,True,,1583567713.0,text,1,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok so no matter where i go, bus station, grocery store, out for a walk, gas station, downtown people always seem to stare at me.

,Anxiety,"I have traveled a whole lot in my life, but I'm not all that happy about it. What sucks most about traveling so often is the fact that there is NEVER anything concrete, every single fucking time it happens, I am forced to leave a whole bunch of the hard work I put into making friends, integrating myself, getting comfortable in the new space and lots of stuff like that. It really sucks, the worst part is when I try to talk about it with someone at school and feel bad about it, it feels horrible. You see, I absolutely adore talking to other people, I love talking about life, games, anime and whatever the fuck else comes to mind, so when I try to convince myself it's a good topic to talk about and it ends up being interesting to the other person I feel really bad, I don't fucking care about this topic, to me it's like unnecessarily derailing a conversation, we're talking about ourselves here, we don't need to talk about ""Oh wow! you've been to \_\_\_\_! That's really cool blah blah blah"", it feels like pandering, and I absolutely hate it, I don't know if I'm paranoid or what but I always feel like I'm being talked down to and patronized, I hate that feeling so much. I recently moved to Colombia, I've lived 3 years here if you put separate years together, I came to Colombia this time and only had like half a week to get ready for school and all that jazz, so, I started school here and there's where this comes from, this uncomfortableness. I've been in this school for about 5 or 6 weeks now, and it sucks. Let's start off with the most simple problem. Since I move so much from country to country I end up in a lot of different schools with a lot of different systems, so I always end up missing big important chunks of information, which ends up being very troubling here in Colombia, since the schools ask a lot from you. So that sucks, it would obviously be easier with a shoulder to lean on and use as support buuuuuut... nope, no such thing exists here right now, and that gets us to our next problem. I don't really have friends at this new school, I feel bad about saying that but I truly feel it, strongly. People have tried to talk to me but it's never been anything interesting, like life, just the generic ""Are you liking this school so far?"", which I've heard a million fucking times by now, it honest to god feels like torture because of how awkward I end up being, you see, I love talking to people, a lot, but I'm super socially awkward, so I end up feeling terrible after saying something serious-sounding to someone who's trying to talk to me, I need to warm up a whole lot before I can get in my comfort zone and talk and act myself, speaking of. I act differently around so many people, I just don't know what to do, it feels like a fucking puzzle game without a proper way to do anything, I feel so fucking lost all the time, the crushing crushing loneliness doesn't help me a fucking bit. One of the things I hate most about feeling this horrendous stress is how it reflects on my mind and feelings, I'm getting so mad about so many insignificant things, it ends up being this constant thing and every time I calm down I feel like absolute fucking trash for getting so mad, and all this comes back to me only to make it worst.

Now, I've said a whole lot of nothing, so let me talk about something a bit more relatable and understandable by the average human being.

We all have something we want to end up doing, even if we aren't fully sure of it or even know it. What sucks is when you know exactly what you want to do but aren't the slightest fucking bit good or descent at it. I hate it. I want to be an animator and/or musician (Singer-Piano). I've bought all these art things and my parents got me a piano for my birthday when I had previously show interest in it. Absolutely all these things (including my parents, aunts, uncles, cousins and even grandparents ) are screaming for me to get a move on and fucking do something. It all feels so fucking crushing for me, keeping in mind that I'm only 14 (15 in July 14th 2020) and have to keep up with all these fucking things, I've got severe whiplash from all of it, and that isn't even the end of it, but I don't want to spend another hour and forty minutes writing this, I've got a headache and am super tired, as you can probably guess.

,Anxiety,"Hi guys! 

Please excuse me if this is terribly formatted, I’m on mobile and don’t generally post anything except for the occasional cat pic.

I’m here for some general advice/tips on how to feel better as I’ve been struggling with really overwhelming anxiety lately. 

Now I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety since my early teens and I’m now 24, but it’s always really been the depression that was worse (with a side of anxiety, I guess). Now, however, I am finding myself having trouble with really REALLY high levels of anxiety. It’s particularly bad at night - I’ve been having panic attacks that seem to last for hours at at time every single night before bed. They leave me feeling weak and faint, my hands and legs go numb, I can’t breathe, I’m super nauseous, my heart pounds and my chest gets these sharp pains and I just have this overwhelming sense of pure terror. I usually end up curled in the foetal position and sobbing by the end. This has had a major impact on my ability to sleep and function. I honestly don’t know what’s triggering the panic attacks, but I know that the thing I worry most about at the moment is my health. When I’m having an attack, i’m obsessed with the thought that something is majorly wrong with me and I’m immediately about to die. I live alone, and the idea that I will just die overnight without the chance to say goodbye to anyone I love TERRIFIES ME. It never used to, but it really does now. I’ve never been particular concerned about my health. I’m young with no diagnosed major health issues (although my anxiety now has me convinced that I have about 27 different ones) The stress from all of this anxiety has caused actual physical symptoms to manifest which, in turn, make me more anxious so I’m stuck in a vicious cycle of freaking out. I’ve always been really good at listening to the rational part of me that speaks up when I’m anxious but I can’t seem to do this lately. The rational voice is still there but nothing it can say or do is enough to convince me that I’m not dying. 

I’m really starting to struggle with every aspect of life because of how exhausted I am and how worked up I get (I do get anxious about a lot of other things too). I’ve been talking to friends and family who have been really great but I feel like I’m being a huge burden with how needy I’ve been lately. I’ve been trying to deal with things constructively: giving up alcohol, going for walks, trying to eat healthier etc. I also saw my doctor and was prescribed a low dose of an antidepressant (which I have had before) and have only been taking this for about a week. I’m hoping to have some success with this, but was also really hoping you guys might be able to offer some tips and advice on getting through the panic attacks in the meantime, until the SSRI starts working to a noticeable degree. If anything, I’ve been getting worse as time goes on so any advice or support at all would be greatly appreciated!

,Anxiety,"Had an anxiety accomplishment that I’m pretty excited about!

So, I am currently looking for a job and new career, which is difficult for a number of reasons, but especially since one of my anxiety triggers is anything relating to jobs (although I mostly seem to be OK being at work and can hold down a job). I recently discovered that the reason is because of my perfectionism and fear of failure after having difficulties with and choosing not to pursue my original career in teaching years ago. I’ve only recently started learning techniques related to perfectionism and getting rid of the uncomfortable thoughts. Before that, I had very little control over it.

I’ve done jobs stuff at home before my perfectionism training, but it never lasted very long at once. I tried using a stopwatch to time myself and tried to go as long as I could so I could figure out how long it took me before I started having anxiety attack symptoms. Unfortunately, that time is very short, lasting only about half an hour to 45 minutes. There were times when I would get to an hour, but I would be feeling pretty sick. Some of my symptoms were stomach pain, rapid heartbeat, and severe loss of concentration.

Today, I decided to and got an opportunity to do a long stretch of job related things. I decided to use the stopwatch again because I found out that was actually a technique that can control perfectionism alongside other ones, and didn’t want it becoming an issue again. This was also One of the first times I had a long stretch since my training and discovery of my job related perfectionism.

I expected to last an hour max, like I normally did.

Instead, I went over two hours with almost no anxiety related symptoms. The only problem I had with some mild frustration when I was reading a book about a career I was interested in but not understanding all of it, and even then, I never felt out of control. I even got what I want to do done that day in terms of job goals.

,Anxiety,"(I tagged this as NSFW for ED triggers and pregnancy triggers)

I’ve (20F) been underweight my whole life. I don’t have any desire to lose weight, but I’m sensitive to foods and eating. 

I’ve decided to eat more and regularly and for the first time since I was a child, I’m a healthy BMI/weight.

However, pregnancy is a huge fear of mine, and since I’ve gained weight my stomach has a slight pouch. My stomach is now a huge trigger of mine and I’ve been freaking out over possibly being pregnant for days now. 

The anxiety is irrational. I have an IUD and I’ve taken several pregnancy tests. I also have no pregnancy symptoms. But I keep freaking over being pregnant. My heart won’t stop beating, and I have a constant adrenaline rush.

I’m considering always using condoms from now on, but I feel like that won’t get rid of the anxiety either since it’s largely irrational. My partner worries that I’ll stop eating regularly to reduce the size of my stomach. I’m just not used to having a normal-sized stomach or not being underweight.

It just sucks that I should be celebrating gaining weight and being healthier, but my anxiety won’t let me. I’ve never been in panic mode for this long consistently.

,Anxiety,"I have no one to listen to my problems so I thought I would write them down. Then I decided to post it on here. 

Just moved to a new city and started at a new school. I don't miss anything from my old hometown, I'm actually quite happy to be somewhere else. Moving has been tough though. I had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends.

I have kind of 'joined' a group of friends at school. They're all pretty nice. The dynamic of the group is a little weird though. Its like 50% introverts who don't talk much, myself included, and 50% strongly opinionated extroverts. They mostly seem like a nice group of people though. In regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. Trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. It's hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. I feel like I'm being ungrateful because even though I think I've been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what I want, I still feel so shit.

I've never been diagnosed but I think I could have depression and/or anxiety. I would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but I don't want to tell my parents how I feel.

Over the past few years I've thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three times in my life. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. I've been researching pills I can get at a chemist that I could overdose on and I've found a suicide bridge that's very close to my house. I've been told that I should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments doesn't seem worth it sometimes.

I'm starting to find it hard to trust myself. I'm like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. During the brief moments when I feel happy about something I worry about my emotions causing me to do something I regret. When I'm sad or empty it's all I can think about.

There's this girl who's not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. She seems like a really nice person. We don't see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. I'm unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it's making me dizzy. I really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but I am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake I make. I feel kind of like It'll never happen, yet I spent the whole afternoon texting her. I feel like I'm going insane.

The people I admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you're always left wanting more from them. I aspire to be like this and make other people happy. I need to remember to smile more though.

Usually I have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non-existent. A month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and hasn't changed much, I think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the time. I just started waking up at 4am every morning out of nowhere and I can't stop. I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.

I feel so lonely. I just want someone to talk to and listen to. Getting to that point with someone new takes time and I'm getting kind of impatient.

I don't know what to do to make myself happy. If things worked out with this girl I think I would be happier, yet the thought of her losing interest in me makes me feel awful.

For the past few months, it's like anxiety has drained me of all of my energy, productivity, and organized thought processes.

The willpower is just not there.

Going new places and having new experiences and meeting new people all used to be so exciting, but I haven't been able to muster up any interest or energy or bravery to do any of that for months.

I'm not looking for help, per se. I know what I have to do and I know it'll get better. But it doesn't FEEL like that, in the moment. It feels like I'm just wasting away. I feel guilty and lazy and it blows.

,Anxiety,"I'm really just using this as a way to vent and just let everything out. But if anyone has advice, it would really be greatly appreciated. This is a bit long, so bear with me.

I have always had anxiety, ever since I was a kid. I Was diagnosed sometime in elementary school (not particularly sure exactly when), and was put on fluoxetine (prozac). Oddly enough, during highschool I slowly stopped taking my meds, and now I don't take any at all. Havn't even done so in at least a year. I somehow managed to open up to my parents about this, and they really want me to take my meds (obviously). My mom has even gone through the lengths to give me some of hers (we take the same thing). 
I have recently started college, and now that I am over 18, I am too old for my previous psychiatrist. So, now I have no psychiatrist, and I only have my own old smelly pills, and the ones my mom gave me. She's been asking whether or not I have been taking them, and Ive been too scared to admit that I have not and lied about it.

Not only this, but academically, I am failing. Last semester, although I was honestly really depressed, I still tried and had a 2.4 GPA, which is pretty good. But this semester, even though I am no longer feeling as horribly depressed, I am doing so much worse academically. I calculated my GPA, and its at 1.6. I am failing 3 whole classes. For some reason, I have completely stopped doing my work. In one of my classes, I need 60 observation hours at a local elementary school, yet I was too scared to email the principle. It's too late to even start my hours fnow, and Im afraid to talk to my professor about it. And once again, I lied. My dad asked if I had gotten them started, and I said that I did. He was really proud of me, and I just feel like a piece of shit. I keep avoiding my work, and now I have started to avoid my classes altogether. I'm supposed to be in class right now, but I am too scared to go. 

I havn't really made any friends, and at this point I just don't want to be here. I want to be in college, and get a job (I'm hoping to be an early childhood teacher) but I'm starting to think that's not possible. I've lowkey given up.

I know I should go to the counseling center, since my university has free counseling for students, but (surprise, surprise!) i'm too scared to go. I've been planning on going since my first semester, but I always just ignore it.

,Anxiety,"Okay so this is sort of weird.

Recently I have been driving a bit into depression which is horribly bad and I just hope it's partly PMS which makes it stronger and it will be less again. But recently my doctor told me I could be having signs of depression so I have been doing my best to work against it.

Just an hour ago I had a mood drops which honestly scared me but it made me have a really bad thought. I managed to shove it off. But then I told a friend of mine about it and while writing him about it, it gave me a sudden burst of anxiety. My chest feels so disgusting. Even now while writing this.

,Anxiety,"Hello!

As a kid, I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( I believe this is the correct diagnosis, I was diagnosed when I was 8-9.) Aside from my blatantly obvious OCD and worrying all the time, I had an issue that still affects me today.

During times of high stress, for whatever reason, my mind is in a hyperactive state sometimes. As a kid, I would watch scary movies or read scary stories, and then my mind would psych myself up to the point where I would be worried that I would see a monster around the corner, so I would have siblings, parents or my dogs come with me to parts of the house such as the basement or the garage. Whenever I was around people, this completely went away and my mind was at ease. I always felt like a chicken afterward but I could feel the adrenaline when it was happening. I never saw anything my mind prepared me to see, nor did I have auditory hallucinations. Whenever it happens, I know it's irrational nevertheless I cannot calm myself down. 

Right before my parent's divorce, this went absolutely crazy. Whenever it was dark, I was frightened when I was alone. I couldn't go to the garage or downstairs alone. When my parents separated and I was in a low-stress environment for the first time in my life, it went away completely for probably a year. Now I'm in another stressful bout in life with my father who is always getting in fights with me, college, and a job I really don't like. Just as an example, I've really been reading up on aliens recently. I'm not a UFO freak nor have I ever claimed to see aliens or a UFO, but I find the topic fascinating. The downside is that this is what my brain uses against me in these episodes. When I wake up before sunrise to get ready for work, I am absolutely terrified to pull my car out of the garage and go outside when it's dark. I expect to look out my window and see an alien-looking back in at me, and I often keep my eyes open when washing in the shower. My entire morning getting ready I'm in fight or flight mode, but once I get to work and I'm around other people, I'm fine. When the sun comes up, this happens to a much lesser extent.

The same thing happens when I go to my basement. I rarely have to go down there. It's dark and colder than the rest of my house. Whenever I go down there, my brain instantly hypes me up and I prepare myself to beat up a monster or ghost or alien or whatever is around the corner, even though there never is one. I know that everything is fine and I'm alone, but I can't calm myself down during these episodes. I know I'm not going to encounter anything yet I'm still in a fight or flight mode.

I have been reading up on this and I am worried that maybe I have schizophrenia or psychosis. From what I've read, I don't have either of these because I recognize that my fears are irrational when they're happening as to believing them as a schizophrenic or psychotic would, although I'm still kind of questioning my own sanity here.

,Anxiety,"Ive suffered from anxiety and panic attacks for a while now.  It can get really bad.  Ive never felt in control, my anxiety ruled my life.  You know the story.

Tonight felt an attack coming on.  I had freaked myself out and the anxiety was ramping up fast and big league.  Picked up a weight and lifted for 30min or so.  Anxiety is very very reduced now, back to manageable levels.  Attack cancelled before it could peak.

The trick is to lift lite weights - not heavy.  This way you can lift for a lot longer and burn off all that anxious energy.  So I'll lift for 5 min or so, take a break for a few min, then lift more.  Don't lift to failure because then you can't keep lifting.

Even if you don't own weights you probably have something ""kind of heavy"" in your house.  Like a 2L or gallon of water.  Its not important that the weight is heavy, just important that it gets lifted a lot.

,Anxiety,"I'll try and make this as concise and easy to read as possible 🙂

**My history:**

I'm a 30 yo guy and I generally have heightened anxiety on a daily basis. Growing up I was bullied (alot) because of being gay and as far as I can tell from therapy etc this has had a big bearing on who I am today. I've tried Lexapro and Zoloft in the past but they gave me alot of side effects so I stopped. My psych at the time said that I didn't really need meds and that they were only a 'crutch' for me. I've been doing CBT for the past couple of years (on and off) with some success but not massively. I have a great partner now but I'm still an anxious guy.

**My anxiety:**

I overthink and worry alot (whether its about my appearance, health, what other people think of me, how im coming across in social situations). I'm a perfectionist and do suffer with fluctuating moods. I guess you could say I'm a very sensitive guy too. I get VERY nervous public speaking or speaking in any group at all (even speaking 1:1 with people I'm afraid my voice will break). Weirdly enough I cannot pee in public (at a urinal) and I regularly have issues keeping an erection during sex. All pretty embarrassing for a 30 yo guy.

**My dry mouth:**

My biggest physical symptom is that I have a chronic dry mouth which really gets me down. It started 2 years ago after a number of panic attacks and it really hasn't gone away. It's ALWAYS on my mind. I've gone to numerous specialists who all told me it was anxiety related. The unfortunate thing is that anti-depressants (the SSRIs I tried) make it worse. I tried all the OTC stuff.

**My job:**

Outside of this I've been pretty successful in my career (I manage a team of 10 people in tech) and have worked across various high intensity roles.

The performance anxiety definitely holds me back and is one of the main reasons I'm writing this today. Everytime I have to speak in public (regardless of the size of the team) I feel so nervous. This never gets better even though I have presented hundreds if not thousands of times in my career to date.

**The future!**

At this stage I'm wondering if I should go back to a psychiatrist and figure out meds again or keep powering through with CBT?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My history:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 30 yo guy and I generally have heightened anxiety on a daily basis. Growing up I was bullied (alot) because of being gay and as far as I can tell from therapy etc this has had a big bearing on who I am today. I&amp;#39;ve tried Lexapro and Zoloft in the past but they gave me alot of side effects so I stopped. My psych at the time said that I didn&amp;#39;t really need meds and that they were only a &amp;#39;crutch&amp;#39; for me. I&amp;#39;ve been doing CBT for the past couple of years (on and off) with some success but not massively. I have a great partner now but I&amp;#39;m still an anxious guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My anxiety:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I overthink and worry alot (whether its about my appearance, health, what other people think of me, how im coming across in social situations). I&amp;#39;m a perfectionist and do suffer with fluctuating moods. I guess you could say I&amp;#39;m a very sensitive guy too.

,Anxiety,"EDIT: Sorry the post is a bit long, I wanted to be as detailed as possible

First, a little background on me, Im a 23 year old male and I have been suffering from depression and anxiety my whole life. The past couple years though, my anxiety has gotten absolutely terrible. I have a horrible time getting myself to even leave the house. I have really bad social anxiety. I have emetophobia (fear of throwing up). I have a bad stutter that has been off and on my whole life but of course, it is really bad right now as i'm going through this time my life. I feel like i'm scared of the world and I just want to stay to myself all the time but its leading me to become more depressed then i've ever been. I have this feeling that i'm not even a man, cause what kind of man is scared to leave the house or talk to people? It's shameful. My father passed away September then I lost my childhood cat in November which has led even more of a feeling of being trapped. I didn't have much of a relationship with my father and I really wish he was around now because I really think he would've been able to help me right now.

Now to yesterday, I was once again fed up with the way I was feeling so I decided that I was going to take action. I have tried exercise (although admiringly, I should do it more) and mediation to try to relieve my symptoms naturally but I haven't had any success. I wanted to try medication so I went on my insurance provider's website and saw that they have virtual office visits where they can prescribe antidepressants that aren't controlled substances. I made an appointment for two hours later and I was feeling so good, I felt like it was the beginning of everything getting better. I had a good conversation with the doctor and he prescribed me with 10mg lexapro daily. I went ahead and got the medication and took one right away. My impressions were that the effects of antidepressants were gradual but I can't say it went that way for me. Within 2 hours, I had the most severe anxiety I've had in a long time, my heart was pounding, I was sweating,  I had a headache, and of course the nausea. I got no sleep last night at all and started doing research on lexapro. Needless to say, im really really scared now. I saw all the stories that matched up with mine and I just don't think I can do it anymore. I think im gonna go back to trying to exercise the anxiety away. Im worried that the side effects are always gonna be to much for me. Im also worried about getting off of them when it comes time and the withdrawal that people report. I mean, if I can't handle getting on them, how am I gonna go through the withdrawal? It seems like it's going to be pretty much the same side effects.  Im sitting here with the same fog over my head since I took it last night, i'm really tired, slightly dizzy, and depressed. Im really starting to feel like there is no way out of this way of thought and i'm really scared.

I am really looking for any sort of advice from the community here. I've always had good luck with reddit, except for a few bad apples, and I figured this might be a good way to reach out for support. I am so torn on what to do with my prescription. I don't know if I want to keep taking it or not. My doctor recommended going down to 5mg for a week then 10mg after that but i'm honestly not sure if i'm going to listen.",t2_hx9sa,False,,0,False,Took the first step last night and I only feel worse,[],r/Anxiety,False,1,adviceneededflair,0,,False,t3_fejwj5,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice Needed,False,1,,False,self,1583529236.0,,[],{},,True,,1583556345.0,text,1,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Sorry the post is a bit long, I wanted to be as detailed as possible&lt;/p&gt;
